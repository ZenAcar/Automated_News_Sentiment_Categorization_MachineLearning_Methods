## Topic
* Created a web-based app that delivers news by sentiment and category where sentiment is informed by a sentiment detection ML model.
* The idea behind a sentiment-driven news app is to allow the user to explore the news in their way, having full control of whether they see positive or negative news.

## Dataset
* Training dataset: kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset
  - Sentiment derived from Vader Sentiment(pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/)
* Testing dataset: https://newsapi.org/
