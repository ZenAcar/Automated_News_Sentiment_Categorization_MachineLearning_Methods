       "A zero-day vulnerability has been discovered in Zoom video conferencing software for Windows that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or older.To successfully exploit the zoom vulnerability, all an attacker needs to do is tricking a Zoom user into performing some typical action like opening a received document file. No security warning is triggered or shown to the user at the time of the attack.The vulnerability has been discovered by a researcher who reported it to Acros Security, who then reported the flaw to the Zoom security team earlier today. The researcher wishes to remain anonymous.Although the flaw is present in all supported versions of the Zoom client for Windows, it is only exploitable on systems running Windows 7 and older Windows systems due to some specific system characteristics.\"This vulnerability is only exploitable on Windows 7 and earlier Windows versions. It is likely also exploitable on Windows Server 2008 R2 and earlier though we didn't test that,\" Mitja Kolsek, 0patch co-founder, said in a blog post published Thursday.While Microsoft ended official support for Windows 7 this January and encouraged users to switch to more secure versions of the operating system, Windows 7 is still widely used by users and organizations at large.Researchers at Acros Security, the creators of 0patch, have developed a micro patch for all versions of Zoom Client for Windows (starting with version 5.0.3 and all up to the latest version 5.1.2) to address the security issue and released them to everyone for free until Zoom Video Communications delivers an official security patch.When a user enables 0patch on their system, the malicious code sent by an attacker doesn't get executed when a Zoom user clicks on the \"Start Video\" button.\"Zoom Client features a fairly persistent auto-update functionality that is likely to keep home users updated unless they really don't want to be,\" Kolsek said.\"However, enterprise admins often like to keep control of updates and may stay a couple of versions behind, especially if no security bugs were fixed in the latest versions (which is currently the case).\"Researchers at Acros Security have also developed a working proof-of-concept exploit for the vulnerability, which they have shared with Zoom and will not release until the company fixes the issue.However, the firm has posted a proof-of-concept video demonstration that shows how a malicious exploit for this vulnerability can be triggered by clicking the \"start video\" button in the Zoom Client.Until Zoom releases a fix for the issue, users can temporarily stop using the Zoom client on their older versions of Windows, or update their OS to a newer version.Users can also implement micropatch released by Acros Security, but since it comes from a third party software company and not Zoom itself, I would not recommend doing that.Due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, the use of Zoom video conferencing software has skyrocketed over the past few months, as it is being used by not just enterprises but also millions of regular users across the world to cope with schooling, business, social engagement, and whatnot.In a statement provided to The Hacker News, Zoom confirmed it has now patched the vulnerability mentioned above with Zoom client version 5.1.3 release.\"Users can help keep themselves secure by applying current updates or downloading the latest Zoom software with all current security updates from https://zoom.us/download.\"Just last month, Zoom addressed two critical vulnerabilities in its video conferencing software for Windows, macOS, or Linux computers that could have allowed attackers to hack into the systems of group chat participants or an individual recipient remotely.In April, a series of issues were uncovered and reported in Zoom , which raised privacy and security concerns surrounding the video conferencing software among millions of its users.Earlier this year, Zoom also patched a serious privacy bug in its software that could have allowed uninvited people to join private meetings and remotely eavesdrop on private audio, video, and documents shared throughout the session.</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/thehackernews</td><td>technology</td><td>A zero-day vulnerability has been discovered in Zoom video conferencing software for Windows that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer running Microsoft Windows 7 or older.</td><td>2020-07-10T12:35:00Z</td><td>Map(name -> Internet, id -> null)</td><td>Unpatched Critical Flaw Disclosed in Zoom Software for Windows 7 - Internet</td><td>https://thehackernews.com/2020/07/zoom-windows-security.html</td><td>https://thehackernews.com/images/-cQek92p6d9o/Xwhe5J2Ch4I/AAAAAAAA3Ag/8np6teFd-DQIXzn6PYQ1iBEj8Og6gRF3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s728-e100/zoom-security.jpg</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Facebook’s iOS SDK is causing a number of popular iPhone apps to crash today, including Spotify, Pinterest, and Tinder.

This most likely means we can expect the same tired gameplay formula we've seen time and time again, all wrapped up in an endless base-building grind that will undoubtedly be connected to the title's in-app purchases. Of course, King has yet to confirm the game even exists, and my guesswork could be way off the mark, so at this point, I'd say it's best to take all of this with a grain of salt until official details come to light.</td><td>null</td><td>technology</td><td>It would appear that two Crash Bandicoot fans (Jump Button and Motwera) have uncovered an upcoming mobile Crash Bandicoot game through a</td><td>2020-07-09T15:19:00Z</td><td>Map(name -> Android Police, id -> null)</td><td>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run is a new auto-runner from King, now available for pre-reg - Android Police</td><td>https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/07/09/king-crash-bandicoot-auto-runner-android/</td><td>https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Crash-Bandicoot-mobile.png</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Taking its design cue from the XPS portable PCs, the new Dell XPS Desktop is a stunning and modern take on the tower PC.

But as this global pandemic shows no signs of slowing (at least in the US), we are still tracking and waiting for the 4a, which we all thought would have been here by now.\n",

       "\n",
       "What is the Pixel 4a and Google’s “a” line of phones?\n",
       "\n",
       "First kicking off with 2019’s Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL, Google decided it needed to not only play in the top-tier flagship phone space, it also wanted to offer a more affordable phone that still gave you the best of Google. The Pixel 3a provided a similar high-end camera experience to Google’s best phones and would receive the same level of software support, only it would cost about half the price. We reviewed the Pixel 3a and loved what it had to offer with a starting price of $399.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since the Pixel 3a was thought to be an early success story in Google’s struggling Pixel business, a follow-up dubbed Pixel 4a only made sense. At the end of 2019, rumors about a Pixel 4a began surfacing, with most in the industry targeting Google I/O 2020 for its arrival.\n",

       "Throughout 2020, we have learned a lot about the Pixel 4a, should Google decide to one day sell us one.\n",
       "\n",
       "Is there a Pixel 4a and a Pixel 4a XL or not?\n",
       "\n",
       "We believe there may be only a single Pixel 4a phone this year, which means the Pixel 4a XL has been cut. There is evidence to suggest that Google was working on both a Pixel 4a and 4a XL, but as this story has evolved, only a single, smaller device keeps surfacing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Pixel 4a has been spotted a number of times now and is expected to be available in Just Black and Barely Blue. We know at least a couple of the model numbers are GA02101-FR (Barely Blue) and GA02099-FR (Just Black), that the phone stopped through the FCC by itself as G025J, G025N, and G025M, and that retailers were recently suggesting 128GB as the base storage.\n",
       "\n",
       "We also believe the Pixel 4a carries the codename “sunfish” internally at Google. The name has popped up in code and in the Google Camera app alongside other codenames “redfin” and “bramble.” Those last two devices both run the Snapdragon 765, a 5G chip that could very well power the Pixel 5. On the other hand, “sunfish” is a single device running the Snapdragon 730, the same chip confirmed to be in the Pixel 4a.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again, we know all of that about the regular Pixel 4a, but nothing has presented itself in the way of a Pixel 4a XL on this level. Even when the phone was fully reviewed in prototype form, we saw no 4a XL, only the regular 4a.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of course, since nothing is official yet and we are simply tracking leaks and early bits of info, this could change and Google could surprise us with a Pixel 4a XL. If they do, it should look like the device above, which has been confirmed through eBay listings of parts for the phone’s backside. We’ll talk specs in a second, but as you can see here, the Pixel 4a XL would have given us a dual camera instead of just the single shooter on the 4a. The added display size might have been nice to have too.\n",

       "Google Pixel 4a Specs\n",
       "\n",
       "The specs for the Pixel 4a won’t blow your mind, but that’s exactly the point of this phone line. This phone should pack enough to give you quick performance, take great still photos, and last all-day without breaking the bank. A Snapdragon 730 processor with 6GB RAM, 128GB storage, and Google’s still-impressive 12MP camera (samples) should provide just that.\n",

Shortly after Dr. Disrespect was permanently banned from Twitch, VoDs of his last stream started making the rounds on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet. Everything looks like business as usual for the internet personality, at least for the first few moments.

Fans claim that his voice and emotions change, his entire demeanor shifting into a defeated look on his face. Dr. Disrespect continues to stream, but he's uncharacteristically quiet and sullen as the stream goes on. Compared to his usual upbeat and confident persona, he becomes a lot more fidgety and seemingly distracted. Some more unusual things occur until Dr. Disrespect seemingly ends his stream in an emotional outburst. This has prompted fans to believe Dr. Disrespect truthfully knows why he was banned, and may have been informed during his final stream.\n",

       "As for why he was banned, no independent sources have been able to confirm why Dr. Disrespect was permanently banned, with the Two-Time Champion claiming he was banned without official notice from Twitch. His wife, Mrs. Assassin, also seems to be emphasizing this as well based on a statement she released on Instagram about the ordeal. But as fans watched and re-watched his last stream, many believe Dr. Disrespect knows exactly why he was banned and isn't willing to say why on the matter. Dr. Disrespect posted that statement on Twitter on June 27, over a week ago.\n",

       "Twitch made an official comment June 26, stating that \"As is our process, we [Twitch] take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There's still been no official word since then from Twitch, nor has Dr. Disrespect made any more statements in any capacity. Of course, rumors have begun to spread wildly in the deafening silence from the iconic streamer. Some industry insiders have cited some very serious allegations and/or actions have led to Dr. Disrespect's ban. Esports industry insider Rod Breslau alleges that the issue itself pertains to a sensitive problem that cannot be unveiled publicly, leading to even more speculation. This was also at the end of June, and since then there's been no word from anyone else on the subject. Obviously, it's inferred that Dr. Disrespect committed some kind of heinous act, but apparently it's going to be a while until onlookers get the full story.\n",

Since his ban is likely permanent, evidenced by the subscription refunds for all his viewers, some have been led to belief he may be joining another game streaming service like Facebook Gaming. But the most prominent rumor leads to a very unlikely source called \"Brime.\" Shortly after Dr. Disrespect's ban, a viral conspiracy based around the Brime Twitter account seemed to be making the rounds on Reddit. There's a lot of reasons why this is very unlikely.\n",
       "\n",
       "Viewers pointed out the fact that Brime was actively following Dr. Disrespect's Twitter profile, and assumed that was link to where the streamer intended to go instead of Twitch. The Brime Twitter account received a lot of attention shortly after Mixer was officially shut down, with conspiracy theorists pointing to Brime as the next big competitor for live streaming games. Since then, the Brime account has continued to spread tons of confusing messaging. Supposedly the name \"Brime\" is just a codename for now, and that the site announcement happening right around when Dr. Disrespect was simply a coincidence and confirmed there's no active negotiations with Dr. Disrespect. Brime still hasn't realistically posted any more information about the service, and could very well be a hoax.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, despite all the rumors and conspiracy theories going around, Dr. Disrespect's permanent ban remains a mystery. With an overbearing silence across the board from the internet personality and those related to him, the real reason as to why he was banned may never come out. At least, not any time soon.\n",

Physicists were faced with an ever-growing zoo of unstable particles that didn't seem to have a role in the Universe around us. Quarks explained all that through an (at least superficially) simple set of rules that built all of these particles through combinations of two or three quarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "While that general outline seems simple, the rules by which particles called \"gluons\" hold the quarks together in particles are fiendishly complex, and we don't always know their limits. Are there reasons that particles seem to stop at collections of three quarks?\n",
       "\n",
       "With the advent of ever-more powerful particle colliders, we've found some indications that the answer is \"no.\" Reports of four-quark and even five-quark particles have appeared in different experiments. But questions remain about the nature of the interactions in these particles. Now, CERN has announced a new addition to growing family of tetraquarks, a collection two charm quarks and two anti-charm quarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "How do you put that together?\n",
       "\n",
       "The quark-based particles we're most familiar with, the proton and neutron, are composed of three of the lightest quarks bound tightly together via gluons. We've also discovered heavier versions of these familiar particles, where one of the up or down quarks is replaced by a heavier quark, like a strange or bottom. In addition, there is a large collection of unstable particles, collectively called mesons, that involve two quarks of various masses, also held together by gluons.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, what happens when you try to cram more quarks in? We're not entirely sure. There are two possibilities that are being considered. In one case, the new high-quark-count particles are made the same way that familiar ones are: gluons bind them tightly together into a single particle. An alternative, however, is that the large number of quarks comes about because two more familiar particles are tightly associated. So, a tetraquark could simply be a tight association of a pair of two-quark particles. A pentaquark would be put together from a two-quark meson associating with a three-quark particle.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unfortunately, we've found it difficult to tell these two options apart. These high-quark-count particles tend to decay extremely rapidly to familiar particles, and it's generally only the decay of those latter particles that we can track. That makes it challenging to determine exactly what's going on further back. So, the more ways we can look at these things, the better. And that brings us to the latest results from CERN, in which a team of scientists has analyzed the data from the first few runs of the LHC.\n",
       "\n",
       "The data comes out of the LHCb experiment, a detector that's specialized in particles containing the very heavy bottom (or beauty) quark. But it's capable of picking up heavier quarks more generally. And the new particle has a lot of heavier quarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Needs more charm\n",
       "\n",
       "So far, all the high-quark-count particles we've found have been a mix of mostly lighter up and down quarks, with a couple of their heavier peers thrown in. But the CERN team was interested in looking for combinations where all the quarks were either charm or anti-charm. Charm quarks are from the middle generation of quarks; charm and strange are heavier than up or down but far lighter than top or bottom.\n",
       "\n",
       "How would we find something like that? Conveniently, a four-charm particle should decay through an intermediate state that involves a pair of two-charm particles. And these we know very well as the J/ψ particle. (Two groups found this particle at roughly the same time and, in a rare moment of compromise, the names given to it by both of them have stuck.) Since we know how J/ψ particles decay, we can simply look for pairs of decays coming out of a single proton-proton collision.\n",
       "\n",
       "The decay of J/ψ particles can, in turn, be recognized by the appearance of a muon-antimuon pair that originates from a single location. (Muons can be thought of as heavier, unstable cousins of the electron.) Since there should be two of the J/ψ particles, then we need to look for two pairs of muon tracks in the aftermath of a collision.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, the researchers scanned a range of energies for an excess of these events. And they find one in the appropriate energy range for a four-charm particle that is five standard deviations from the expected background noise. That means it meets the standard for discovery in particle physics.\n",
       "\n",
       "The new particle, currently unnamed, is the first with more than three quarks that is composed entirely of one type of quark, as well as the first to be composed entirely of heavier quarks. And, given that the specific quark is called \"charm,\" its existence opens vast possibilities for puns‐and that's without even getting into the fact that the technical term for the full family of particles containing these quarks is \"charmonium.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "What’s its deal?\n",
       "\n",
       "But the big question hasn't been answered: what's the nature of the new particle? We don't know if it's simply two J/ψ particles in tight association or whether there's a single particle composed of four charm quarks. The answer is fairly important, since it would provide information on the strong force that governs all quark-gluon interactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the more of these particles we have to study, the greater the chances are that we'll be able to determine the details of what it takes to build them. So, while it would have been nice if this particle immediately heralded the solution to an outstanding question, its discovery is likely to represent progress toward a solution.\n",

It looks like OnePlus will also offer the option to configure the phone with more RAM and storage. Most of the reports published before this slide came out said the OnePlus Nord would feature 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. So the fact it may now include as much RAM as the OnePlus 8 Pro seems almost too good to be true.

It measures over 26-inches tall and is designed to be in proper scale with the various 6-inch Marvel Legends. It also includes 72 points of articulation (including 20 in each hand) and an 18-inch tentacle accessory.If you need further incentive, Hasbro is including an exclusive Marvel Legends Bastion figure.

The TVs' OLED displays use organic light-emitting diode technology to deliver a contrast ratio, viewing angles, and a wide color gamut that no LCD TV (or QLED TV) can match. As the least expensive OLED TV from 2019, the B9 is still our favorite premium TV overall for high-end shoppers. It fell just a bit short of the CX (below) in image quality in our tests, but the differences are minuscule -- and since it's less expensive than the CX, it's a better value.

In short, the claim is that Toyota will fit the boosted inline-six from the BMW M3/M4 under the Supra’s hood, where it will generate the same 510-plus hp as Bimmer’s Competition models.

Such a low number would certainly make this Supra less of a threat to BMW sales. But wait, there’s more.\n",

For even more detail, be sure to check out our hands-on Canon EOS R5 review.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Its new 45MP sensor could capture more detail than any other Canon camera\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the key specs missing from earlier Canon EOS R5 teaser announcements was its resolution. Well, that's now been answered: it will have a brand-new 45MP sensor. This means it should be ideal for the likes of landscape photographers, who demand maximum detail and cropping potential.\n",
       "\n",
       "That's not the end of the story, either. Canon told us that even though the EOS R5's sensor is 'only' 45MP, it could even out-resolve previous 50MP cameras like the Canon EOS 5DS.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "As Canon Product Marketing Specialist David Parry told us: \"Even though it's 45MP, we're saying this [the Canon EOS R5] could potentially be the highest-resolving camera we’ve ever produced.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We have the 5DS and 5DSR, which are 50MP, but because the low-pass filter on here has been completely redesigned, it means that the actual image detail on this could be the highest we’ve produced.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With these resolution claims, plus an ISO range of 100-51,200 (expandable to ISO 102,400), this is one sensor we're looking forward to taking for a spin.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. It has new Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus powers\n",
       "\n",
       "While the Canon EOS R5 makes the obligatory claim of having the \"world's fastest autofocus\" (a boast that means very little in reality), the more interesting aspect of its AF powers is that it has what Canon is calling Dual Pixel CMOS AF II.\n",
       "\n",
       "Canon's original Dual Pixel CMOS AF system, which first arrived on the Canon 70D in 2013, remains one of the best AF systems around, alongside Sony's Real-time tracking AF.\n",
       "\n",
       "But it appears that Dual Pixel CMOS AF II is a new response to the latter, as it brings next-gen tracking powers that should prove very handy for wildlife and sports shooters.\n",

It's a similar story for animals too – you get face and eye-tracking for cats, dogs and birds, along with body tracking for when they turn away from you.\n",
       "\n",
       "Canon originally developed Deep Learning AF for the now-postponed 2020 Olympics to allow sports photographers to track athletes, even if they were wearing face-obscuring kit like crash helmets.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's not based on AI that can teach itself, as other cameras and phones sometimes claim, but is instead trained by a huge database of images. The resulting possibility of getting eye-tracking for flying birds, for example, is an exciting one.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. It has the Digic X factor\n",
       "\n",
       "The real breakthrough on the Canon EOS R5, and the technology that enables it to handle features like Dual Pixel CMOS AF II, is its Digic X processor.\n",
       "\n",
       "This first appeared in the Canon 1D X Mark III earlier this year, and while Digic X is a family of processors that differ depending on the camera they're powering, Canon told us that the EOS R5's chip is almost exactly the same as the one in the 1D X Mark III.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "This is what has allowed Canon to leave behind the frustrating limitations of Digic 8 cameras, like cropped 4K or autofocus limitations, and deliver some pretty extraordinary data handling on the EOS R5.\n",
       "\n",
       "Shunting around 8K/30p Raw video while retaining Dual Pixel autofocus simply isn't possible on any other camera.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. The IBIS system gives you up to eight stops of stabilization\n",
       "\n",
       "We knew from previous announcements that the EOS R5 would be the first Canon camera with in-body image stabilization – and now we know more about how it works.\n",
       "\n",
       "The headline is that it can offer up to eight stops of image stabilization, depending on the lens you're using. That's hugely impressive in theory, beating even the Olympus E-M1 Mark III's maximum of 7.5 stops – and that camera has a far smaller Four Thirds sensor.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "What's interesting about the EOS R5's system is how versatile it is – it works with RF, EF and EF-S lenses, and also on lenses that don't have any existing stabilization. The latter don't just get the body's basic stabilization either, with the RF 28-70mm f/2 getting the full eight stops, despite not having any built-in stabilization.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is because the level of stabilization is more down to the size of the image circle that's projected into the camera, than the two-way communication between camera and lens. The RF 28-70mm f/2 is designed to be clean right to the edges, so has a large enough area to give you the full eight stops of stabilization.\n",
       "\n",
       "It also means that you can whack on some old lenses that have no way of communicating with the EOS R5, and they'll still get some stabilization. Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any handheld high-res shot modes, as on Olympus cameras, but so far the stabilization system sounds very impressive.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. You'll be able to shoot 8K Raw video for 20 minutes\n",
       "\n",
       "Before the official launch announcement, one of the biggest concerns about the EOS R5 was how long you'd be able to shoot 8K video for. After all, even recording 4K video can generate a lot of heat, which sees other cameras quit after 15 or 30 minutes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Impressively, the Canon EOS R5 is apparently able to shoot 8K/30p, 12-bit Raw video – which is its highest setting – for a maximum of 20 minutes, before the camera gets too hot and shuts down.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "That's longer than we were expecting, given that the EOS R5 doesn't have any internal fans. According to Canon, it's also down to maximizing energy efficiency, and choosing materials that don't generate a lot of heat.\n",
       "\n",
       "This also means there's no limit on how long you can shoot 4K video for on the EOS R5, aside from battery life or your memory card capacity.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. It has the highest-resolution EVF on any Canon camera\n",
       "\n",
       "One design detail we didn't know about was the resolution of the Canon EOS R5's electronic viewfinder – well, we now know it has a 5.76-million dot EVF, which is the highest-res so far on any Canon camera.\n",
       "\n",
       "This trumps the 3.69 million-dot EVF seen on the Canon EOS R6, and matches the viewfinder found on the Panasonic S1, which is the best one we've had the pleasure of composing images with so far.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "The EOS R5's EVF also has a 120fps refresh rate, which means it's twice as fast as the one on the Canon EOS R, although we can't say we found lag to be an issue on the latter camera.\n",
       "\n",
       "That higher refresh rate can also have an impact on battery life, as you'll discover in point 8 below.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. It won't replace the EOS 5D Mark IV or EOS R\n",
       "\n",
       "Canon was at pains to point out that the EOS R5 isn't a replacement for existing cameras like the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV or Canon EOS R, but rather a mirrorless alternative that will sit alongside them.\n",
       "\n",
       "While it's comfortably more powerful than both of those cameras, this is potentially good news for those who can't an afford or justify an EOS R5 (that's most of us).\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Canon)\n",
       "\n",
       "Whether you want to buy an EOS 5D Mark IV or EOS R new or secondhand, the release of the EOS R5 will likely push down the prices of both models. Your route into the RF system may soon become a bit more affordable, thanks to the arrival of the Canon EOS R5 and EOS R6.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. It has a new battery (but is compatible with old ones)\n",
       "\n",
       "Canon has made a new battery for the EOS R5 that's the same size as the current LP6-N, but has a higher capacity.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was needed to help power features hi-res EVF, though, so don't expect any major battery life improvements. In fact, the R5 only manages a slightly disappointing 320 shots per charge if you're using the EVF (at 60fps refresh rate), or 490 shots if you're using the LCD instead. This is where DSLRs still hold a big advantage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, the new LP-E6NH is backwards compatible with other cameras and batteries from cameras like the 5D series or 90D will work with the R5.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. It's seriously expensive\n",
       "\n",
       "As Canon's new flagship mirrorless camera, the EOS R5 was always going to be pricey, and sure enough it will come with a body-only price of $3,899 / £4,199 / AU$6,899 when it goes on sale on 30 July.\n",
       "\n",
       "Historically, that's not too bad, considering the Canon EOS 5D Mark IV started at $3,499 / £3,599 / AU$5,060 back in 2016 – it means the EOS R5 isn't that much more expensive than its spiritual DSLR predecessor when you take inflation into account.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "Of course, there wasn't a global pandemic or economic crisis in 2016, which means we'll be carefully eyeing the prices of the Canon EOS R and Canon EOS RP to see if their new siblings do indeed puts some welcome downward pressure on their prices.\n",

       "\n",
       "Even though the original Nintendo Switch arrived in 2017, there have been some evolutions since then. The more affordable, handheld-only Switch Lite arrived last fall, and has been the Switch that's been the easiest to find in stock online. The dockable original Switch got a significant battery life boost at that time, too.\n",
       "\n",
       "While Nintendo's TV-connected consoles usually haven't gotten many updates after launch, Nintendo handhelds tend to get evolutions every couple of years. The Nintendo 3DS (early 2011) was followed by the larger-screened 3DX XL (mid-2012), the Nintendo 2DS (2013), New Nintendo 3DS and New Nintendo 3DS XL (late 2014-early 2015), and New Nintendo 2DS XL (2017).\n",
       "\n",
       "On that timeline, getting another Switch update, even if it's not a full 2.0 version, later this year or early next year wouldn't be unusual at all. In fact, I'd expect it.\n",

       "I could dream all day of how a brand-new Switch 2 could push modular gaming into uncharted territory, but the Switch is in a major success mode now and it seems extremely unlikely that Nintendo would shake that up. Tweaking the hardware formula, however, with some extra perks in a shiny new model seems like a very likely move.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Switch is a system that gets a lot of wear and tear: Joy-Cons break, backs crack, they take dings and get tossed around by accident. Moving to a new version every few years isn't a crazy idea for a serious player.\n",

       "An XL version with a larger screen (and 1080p?)\n",
       "\n",
       "I admit, I squint at the Switch screen a lot, especially the smaller Switch Lite. The 3DS went bigger-screen and it could be an easy move to make an XL Switch that reduces the large bezels and expands the screen across the body. Maybe 7 inches, or 7.5. Make the display better and brighter, maybe even allow it to show the better 1080p resolution you can get on the docked Switch games.\n",
       "\n",
       "An improved processor\n",
       "\n",
       "The older Nvidia Tegra processor on the Switch can handle games just fine, but that venting fan on top shows it has to chug a little more than I'm comfortable with. Besides not requiring a venting fan (maybe), an improved Switch could also aim to boost handheld performance up to what the docked Switch can do. It's always been a bit weird that the Switch offers better graphics when docked than in handheld mode. Maybe a next-gen processor could help.\n",
       "\n",
       "Easier docking\n",
       "\n",
       "If the onboard processor can handle graphics better, maybe that also means that the weird, bulky Switch dock can be shrunken down, too.

Leyou has a number of subsidiaries which make video games. It is most well-known for \"Warframe,\" a title created by subsidiary Digital Extremes. It has also announced plans to bring out a game based around \"The Lord of the Rings\" franchise and is co-developing the upcoming title with Amazon's gaming division. Leyou and its controlling shareholder, Charles Yuk, have entered into an exclusivity agreement with Tencent Mobility Limited, a Tencent subsidiary, Leyou said. Tencent Mobility is looking to buy Leyou and take it private. Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis, noted that Leyou began life as a food processing company before pivoting to games and buying up developers like Digital Extremes and Splash Damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My view is that it is looking for a buyer because its main service game Warframe suffered in 2019 due to a slow update cycle and new competition,\" he told CNBC by email Friday. \"Although it has a growth strategy for the title, it will need investment in development to drive engagement.\" The exclusivity agreement means that Leyou and Yuk won't be able to negotiate with another potential buyer in the next three months while the Tencent talks are ongoing. Leyou said the negotiations were still in progress and that there was no certainty the talks would lead to a binding deal. The firm had earlier halted trading in its shares pending an incoming takeover announcement.\n",

       "\"Apple puts most of the emphasis on the production that is streamed to millions of viewers anyway,\" Bajarin says. \"They've got this down.\"\n",

       "No hands-on experience\n",
       "\n",
       "For journalists and analysts, the exciting thing about covering the iPhone reveal is running from the theater, where the keynote was held, to the \"hands-on\" room, to see for ourselves what the new phones actually look and feel like.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rich DeMuro, a tech reporter for KTLA-TV in Los Angeles, and the author of \"101 Handy Tech Tips for the IPhone: Updated, Simplified and Revised for IOS 12,\" says it's all about getting into that room to see the product for ourselves.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can see the nuances in the software, and understand what the product is going to look like before it hits store shelves,\" by getting to see the product up close, he says. The journalists in the room act like \"detectives,\" to figure out the differences between the levels of phones, and get to compare them, for instance, to older models, since Apple doesn't make those available.\n",
       "\n",
       "It also provides oodles of authentic, less staged photos of the products by the blogging set, since Apple's are ultra-shiny, minimizing the warts by showcasing, say, iPhones held in midair by an invisible string.\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple heldits annual Worldwide Developers Conference online in June, due to COVID-19, and Bajarin says it went off without a hitch.\n",
       "\n",
       "He believes that Apple could actually present the hands-on experience more effectively online. \"You would take each unit, and look at it, front, back and side. There is nothing of the actual hands-on experience you can't replace virtually.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The hype will still be there\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple will get the same amount of attention for the iPhone launch as it normally would have because it's an iPhone event, staged for the most sold and best-loved device in the United States, says Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But there's just something about being there live,\" notes Ives. \"I've been covering tech events for 20 years and attended hundreds of product launches,\" he says. \"But nothing matches the excitement and anticipation of being live at an iPhone launch. It's electric.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Samsung event, slated for August 5 at 7 p.m. EDT, is advertised as \"live on Samsung.com,\" as opposed to the last company event, held at the tony Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco to introduce the latest Galaxy S phones.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ives says that while Samsung is a huge international brand, in the United States it doesn't have the pull of an Apple, and thus will see less coverage virtually than it might have in person. \"It's more of an uphill battle for them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, Bajarin says the days of tech conferences are mostly done until late 2021, due to the fear of gathering in big contagious crowds.\n",

If you count yourself among those facing the same dilemma, then keep reading. This article summarizes the most salient points to consider.\n",
       "\n",
       "Where Have I Heard of Arm Before?\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple is no stranger to Arm-based architecture, and if you're already wedded to the Apple ecosystem, you probably own a device powered by Arm chips. iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV all use Advanced RISC machine (Arm-based) processors instead of Intel chips, which use the CISC instruction set.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "In fact, the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac Pro, Mac mini, and Mac Pro are already equipped with Apple-designed Arm processors, in the form of the T1 and T2 chips that power the Touch Bar, Secure Enclave, and other features in these machines.\n",
       "\n",
       "Indeed, Apple's familiarity with the architecture is one of the reasons the company has decided that it's time to make the wholesale switch for its desktop and notebook machines.\n",

       "Will Arm-Based Macs Be Better Than Intel Macs?\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple says it has been working on a family of system-on-chip processors for its desktop and notebook Macs that will usher in a new set of features and deliver \"incredible performance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple loves superlatives, but the details are still thin, so it's hard to know exactly what performance gains are in store. But based on past and current architecture, there are some benefits we can be sure of.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Thanks to Apple's years of experience honing power-efficient chips for its ‌Apple Watch‌ and iOS devices, it's fair to say that we can expect a better balance of high performance and low power consumption. Apple's custom chips will also provide best-in-class security with the Secure Enclave, along with high-performance graphics capabilities for professional apps and games.\n",
       "\n",
       "‌Apple Silicon‌ chips will also include Neural Engines and Machine Learning Accelerators, making Macs ideal platforms for machine learning. Other technologies set to feature include a high-quality camera processor, performance controller, high-performance DRAM, unified memory, and cryptography acceleration.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition, Apple has developed several custom technologies that it can build into ‌Apple Silicon‌ to integrate the system and further boost the Mac's capabilities, making it stand out from the competition. Just take the T2 chip in current Macs, which integrates the system management controller, the image signal processor, the SSD controller, and a Secure Enclave with a hardware-based encryption engine, not to mention the Touch Bar and Touch ID.\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "By going all-in with its own silicon, Apple is increasing its ability to control both the software and the hardware, just like it does for iPhones and iPads, which should make for an improved user experience overall. Not only that, apps designed for the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌ will run on ‌Apple Silicon‌ natively when the first Mac with an Apple-designed chip is released.\n",
       "\n",
       "How Much Faster Will ‌Apple Silicon‌ Macs Be?\n",
       "\n",
       "The truth is we don't know yet. Apple seems confident in the future performance of its Arm-based Macs. Presently, Apple is providing developers with a Developer Transition Kit, which is a ‌Mac mini‌ with an A12Z iPad Pro chip. This is based on a 2019 Arm CPU that was designed for the ‌iPad‌, so shouldn't be seen as representative of what Arm Mac performance will ultimately be.\n",
       "\n",
       "Due to the change in CPU architecture, current Intel Mac software will be translated under Rosetta -- this means that performance of unoptimized software will be slower until developers have a chance to support the new Arm processors.\n",
       "\n",
       "Early benchmarks show how the developer kit performs with unoptimized software, and delivers benchmarks roughly on par with 2013 to 2015-era MacBook Pros.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's worth noting, however, that the Arm-powered 2019 ‌iPad Pro‌ running Arm-native benchmarking software is faster than the 13-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ (2019) in single core and multi-core benchmarks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, these early benchmarks seem promising, bearing in mind that Apple's Arm-based Macs that run ‌Apple Silicon‌ will have new chips designed for specifically for the Mac and based on the A14 chip created for the 2020 ‌iPhone‌ lineup with a 5-nanometer process.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Are the First ‌Apple Silicon‌ Macs Due to Launch?\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Apple has demoed Rosetta 2 with apps and games, and shown that there's no apparent difference between running an Intel app on an Intel machine versus an ‌Apple Silicon‌ machine. Everything works as you'd expect, but if performance is important to you it may take some time for all your software to be updated to support the new processors.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you rely on Adobe software, the good news is that Apple has given Adobe early access to its Arm-based architecture, and Photoshop and Lightroom are reportedly already running smoothly on ‌Apple Silicon‌.\n",

       "What If I Need My Mac to Run Windows?\n",

       "Unfortunately, Boot Camp won't be available on Macs that run ‌Apple Silicon‌, and existing virtualization solutions also won't support running Intel Windows. Even if VMWare or Parallels were to offer that support, it would suffer from slower performance due to the different CPU architectures involved.\n",
       "\n",
       "Microsoft does have its own native Arm version of Windows it uses on its Surface Pro X, but that is only available to manufacturers who resell Microsoft products under their own name and branding. As far as we know, there are no current plans make an Arm-based version of Windows available for Macs.

       "In addition, Apple's existing Mac lineup has never looked in better shape. The 16-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ and the recently updated 13-inch ‌MacBook Pro‌ in particular are well-rounded machines that offer very impressive performance across the board.\n",
       "\n",
       "If running Windows is an important factor, then buying a current generation Intel Mac makes more sense than waiting. Intel Macs will be supported for years to come with new Intel Macs still in the pipeline.\n",
       "\n",
       "In addition, if you are looking to buy a higher end Mac with specific software where performance is important to you, it also may not be worth waiting. Early ‌Apple Silicon‌ Macs may not replace the top-of-the-line for some time and native software will take some time to arrive.\n",

       "\n",
       "“Silhouettes are really important,” Marino said. “This one definitely pushes the boundaries of it. But we tried creative things like with the Frenzy and we’re like, ‘How can we fit a dragon into this situation?’ And we found a cool opportunity to take its tail and wrap it around the bottom of the magazine to put it into the correct shape. That way, if someone sees it on the ground, they immediately know what it is, and if you see it in first person you know what it is.”\n",
       "\n",
       "The more complicated task was making the Elderflame set feel fair to use. One challenge is that the skins need to feel complex and unique, with all the details specific to each dragon, without actually taking up more screen real estate than any other skins. After all, covering more of the screen would make the skin objectively worse to use.\n",
       "\n",
       "According to Marino, the Operator sniper rifle proved to be particularly challenging, “We were on the verge of cutting it, because it’s the only dragon that has wings,” Marino said. “It was like, if you open up these wings, now it takes up all of your screen space, and that compromises competitive integrity.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Yeah, there were at least a couple of moments where Marino would turn to me and be like, ‘Can we ship this skin line without an Operator?’” Khanolkar chimed in, laughing. “And I was like, ‘OK, well we have a couple of months; let’s just see [...] and it did somehow make it. It was just intense collaboration between the group and refusing to let it fall through.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Perhaps the most specific struggle of the skins, though, was making them feel balanced, even if there wasn’t actually anything unbalanced about them. According to Khanolkar, this was one of the problems the team ran into early on with the Elderflame skins.\n",
       "\n",
       "“[They] had a long summon animation,” Khanolkar said. “It [was] this kind of swoopy ‘gun materializes’ thing. And it was cool. But everyone was like, ‘I hate this. I know it’s the same speed, but it feels slower and that messes with me.’”\n",
       "\n",
       "Since the actual time it took to equip the weapons with Elderflame skins was the same as any other gun skins, it was all about feel. And the only way to find the perfect feel was through lots and lots of testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "“We did extensive testing with our design play-test crew, which is, like, our highest ELO players who play twice a day and test maps, characters, everything, and of course, skins,” she said. This team went back and forth with the art team and the animators constantly on each of the skins to make sure that they all felt just right.\n",
       "\n",
       "During our interview on Monday, before Riot’s well-received skin teaser on Wednesday morning, both Marino and Khanolkar were excited but nervous about how players would react when the skins drop on July 10.\n",
       "\n",
       "“It would be the most heartbreaking thing if [players] look at this and [are] like, ‘Yeah it’s a dragon gun, I guess,’” Khanolkar said. But, she said, if players like the Elderflame skins, then the team can see just how much further and weirder it can get with Valorant skins in the future.</td><td>Austen Goslin</td><td>technology</td><td>Valorant’s great-looking new Elderflame skin line is more elaborate than any other cosmetic in the game, but items as complicated as these new Judge, Vandal, Operator, Frenzy, and Knife skins weren’t easy for Riot to make.</td><td>2020-07-09T13:33:58Z</td><td>Map(name -> Polygon, id -> polygon)</td><td>How Riot made Valorant’s new dragon-themed Elderflame gun skins - Polygon</td><td>https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/9/21317964/valorant-elderflame-dragon-gun-skins-weapons-operator-judge-frenzy-knife-vandal</td><td>https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kX6vwu_TdyvscjnzhVOUO69byYE=/143x0:1597x761/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20073722/ElderFlame_Thumbnail_Final_v1.jpg</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>A newly released iOS app from Epic Games lets developers record facial expressions that can be imported directly into the Unreal Engine, using little more than an iPhone’s front-facing camera.

       "\n",
       "Between the spear-stabbing Dominique, the bomb-chuckin' sniper Robert, and Hachi – a dog in a mech that can stomp on spikes, hover in place, and temporarily go invincible – there's a character for every playstyle.

In terms of sequel refinements, the checkpoints are more considerate and clear, the bosses are more elaborate (and they have health bars), and the multi-playthrough payoff is much stronger.\n",

       "Every single character – especially Dominique and Robert – has a time and a place. They're all a blast to play as and freely swap between.

Here’s Heritage with a neat explanation of the so-called cardboard hangtab that makes this unit so rare:\n",
       "\n",
       "What’s the deal with cardboard hangtabs? one may, understandably, wonder. Cardboard hangtabs were originally used on the US test market copies of black box games, back before plastic was used to seal each game. As Nintendo began to further establish their company in the US, their packaging was updated almost continuously. Strangely, the addition of the plastic wrap came before the box cutting die was altered to remove the cardboard hangtab. This rendered the functionality of the cardboard hangtab completely useless, since it was under the plastic seal. There are four sub-variants of the plastic sealed cardboard hangtab box (this particular copy of Super Mario Bros. being the “3 Code” variant) that were produced within the span of one year. Each sub-variant of the cardboard hangtab black box, produced within that timeframe, had a production period of just a few months; a drop in the bucket compared to the title’s overall production run. In short, a cardboard hangtab copy of any early Nintendo Entertainment System game brings a certain air of “vintage” unrivaled by its successors.\n",

       "Yet why, of all items, is this one worth $114,000? We can’t be entirely sure, as the auction winner remains anonymous. Typically, these buyers, often very wealthy, like to stay that way.

I've spent hours debating myself over which class or race to play, but few other choices in World of Warcraft, like what gear to wear, is as meaningful because the answer is often so obvious. It's a consequence of Blizzard having to constantly trim features to stop its 16-year-old MMO from collapsing in on itself, and despite efforts to inject interesting choices into how you customize your character at endgame, WoW just always feels a little too straight forward. But Shadowlands, the upcoming expansion, might be Blizzard's most concerted effort to bring actual, game-changing character customization back to its MMO—but not everyone is convinced it'll work.\n",

       "When players hit level 60 in Shadowlands, they'll have to make a crucial choice to enlist with one of four Covenants. Each represents one of Shadowlands' main factions: The vampiric Venthyr, the Necrolords of Maldaxxus, the whimsical Night Fae, or the divine Kyrians. These Covenants are almost as important as deciding whether you're in the Alliance or the Horde, as each has a distinct aesthetic and tons of unique options both in how you look and play.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's a lot to take in, but by the time players are required to make that choice they'll have already completed Shadowlands' main campaign and spent hours in each Covenant's zone, completing quests, meeting their chief characters, and experimenting with the powerful abilities each one offers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Likely the most important thing to consider is that each Covenant grants players a unique ability based on their class and a second ability shared by all players of that Covenant.

       "Each Covenant also gives you access to Soulbinds, a kind of skill tree full of passive buffs that you'll unlock gradually as you play. Each Covenant has three Soulbinds to choose from, each geared toward a different play style. That basically equates to having 12 skill trees to choose, with the option of being able to level and rotate between three.

       "The choice doesn't have to be purely driven by stats, though. Covenants benefit from Blizzard's excellent worldbuilding, too. The Shadowlands is uncharted territory as far as the original lore goes, but I love how different it feels to anything else I've seen in Azeroth. Each place I travel to instantly becomes my new favorite. The sinister red sky above the Venthyr's crumbling gothic architecture is great, but I'm equally as intrigued by Prince Renathal and his host of Victorian-era vampires who are planning a revolution just so they can get back to hosting formal galas and drinking blood.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you've played Legion, you'll immediately recognize a bit of the DNA from its class Order Halls in Covenants. Like Order Halls, each one has a sprawling endgame quest campaign that will, over time, see you rebuild your Covenant's stronghold, dumping resources into building structures that unlock features like extra fast travel options and unique cosmetic rewards like armor styled after your chosen faction.\n",
       "\n",
       "What I love, however, is that Covenants are a choice independent of everything else. In Legion, Class Order halls were just a reflection of whatever class I chose, and Battle For Azeroth's war campaign was a result of being either an Alliance or Horde-aligned race. It made these features feel like implicit consequences instead of actual choices. Choosing a Covenant, by comparison, feels so meaningful it borders on intimidating—especially because switching to a new one resets your progress and Blizzard has said switching back will be even harder. It's like I'm the transfer student in a high school comedy: Do I hang out with the goths, the theater nerds, the hippies, or the bible club?\n",

       "On paper, this all sounds fantastic, but Covenants are a hotly debated topic in the WoW community. The problem centers on each Covenant's main ability and how powerful they are in certain scenarios. The Venthyr, in particular, are where players are most concerned because Door of Shadows could be used to teleport past certain fights in dungeons and raids or used in all sorts of wacky ways in PvP. Meanwhile, Kyrians' big ability calls an owlman butler to give you a health potion. It's a little unbalanced.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a casual player who just cares about running dungeons occasionally and looking badass, that might not influence which Covenant they choose. But if you're the only person in a Mythic+ dungeon group without Door of Shadows and you're preventing everyone from skipping a combat encounter that could save them precious seconds needed to earn that bit of extra loot. Nobody wants to be that person, so there's going to be a lot of pressure to pick whichever Covenant players decide is best.\n",

That's a very valid concern.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On paper, Hazzikostas wants Covenants to feel like asking someone whether mages or hunters are the better class. \"You could ask people in the best raiding guilds in the world, people who were in the [Mythic Dungeon Invitational] which is better, and it's still not 100 percent clear. It depends on a lot of things. It depends on a lot of situations. Both are great, but which is more fun, which do you enjoy playing more? That's actually a valid answer that can drive you, and there's no wrong choice between those two. That's what we want Covenants to be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It's a noble goal, but a lot of people are skeptical of whether Blizzard can actually deliver. Back in April, PreachGaming made an excellent video dissecting why Covenant abilities were such a scary problem, focusing specifically on how Venthyr's Shadow of Doors has so much potential in dungeons and raids that no other class ability can have. If players have to choose between picking a Covenant that lets them be competitive versus one that just looks really nifty, chances are they'll take the latter.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's an awkward situation right now because Shadowlands is still several months from release and still technically in an alpha state. So much can and will change. But considering how Covenants are the central progression system in Shadowlands, a lot is riding on whether they're satisfying. In yesterday's livestream, Hazzikostas explained that tuning and balancing is something that typically happens much later in development. It was an appeal for players to trust in Blizzard's development process. But seeing as how Battle for Azeroth, the current expansion, missed the mark on some of its biggest ideas, a little skepticism seems necessary.\n",
       "\n",
       "As a more casual player, I'm not as worried about min-maxing every bit of my character as I am having fun and looking cool. But Hazzikostas' earlier point is extremely insightful: Many of WoW's most hardcore are also its most notable influencers and streamers—tastemakers who, through guides, tutorials, and podcasts help define WoW's esoteric minutiae for millions of less serious players. And even if Covenants are imbalanced in a way that'll only affect those who care about those tiny optimizations, it'll trickle down to average players, who may be punished for not making optimal choices even when in situations where it really doesn't matter. If you've ever been kicked from a non-competitive raid group for not having the proper achievements or for making an honest mistake during a fight, you'll know how frustrating that kind of elitism can be.\n",

Hazzikostas has admitted before that Battle for Azeroth didn't get as much time in beta as it should have, resulting in Blizzard not being able to incorporate feedback from players who then felt extra frustrated by problems they'd spent months complaining about. It doesn't seem like that'll be the case with Shadowlands.\n",

       "The obvious answer for many players is to make Covenants something you can switch between without consequence, or to make their abilities freely available regardless of which one you join.

Cardboard hangtabs were originally used on the US test market copies of black box games, back before plastic was used to seal each game. As Nintendo began to further establish their company in the US, their packaging was updated almost continuously.

You'll rarely see a Samsung phone excel in the battery department if you enjoy all of its features, and that's okay. That's actually valid for most phones out there. However, I feel the Note 10+ would have really shone if it had a slightly larger battery at the expense of a slightly thicker body, as it would have made a great phone even better. These days, if I use the Note 10+ like I really want to and don't care that much about power conservation, it would last me a day, not more. Sometimes, if I really push things hard and use it a lot in the mornings, I'd have to top it up around 3 or 4pm if I want to have any juice left by the evening. That's not great, but you get used to it and adapt accordingly. There are many phones with better battery life, but many of them can't match the same feature set as the Note 10+, and that kind of makes up for the good, but not great battery life.\n",

It has an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that's not as fast as the optical ones and it definitely feels slower than many other devices with such scanners embedded into their displays. The accuracy is a bit iffy as well: on the average, 2 or 3 out 10 fingerprint unlocks will require a second attempt, which is definitely a nuisance. Of course, nobody's forcing you to use the embedded fingerprint scanner! You can use the face unlock feature... which only works as intended half the time. It's not a 3D solution so it uses the selfie camera, making it slow, not very safe, and not working well when you are wearing any extra apparel or in a position that the face unlock doesn't really like.\n",

       "Though most of us will have to wait until next year to try New World, there’s still an early access opportunity: if you signed up for the beta on or before July 9th, already preordered the game, or are a current alpha tester “in good standing,” you’ll be able to participate in a “first-hand look at New World” beginning on the game’s previously scheduled launch date, August 25th, according to an FAQ on the New World website.\n",

Not every camera maker has followed Panasonic’s lead yet by removing the standard 30 minute limitation on hybrid cameras, and some limit on the record time was expected. It’s the recovery times that look the worst.\n",

       "The idea, detailed in Geoff Keighley's Final Hours of Half-Life: Alyx, was in development during 2013 and would've added an element of proceduralism to Half-Life. Players would have to navigate a procedurally generated building to save a prisoner and engage in random enemy encounters.

       "The idea was ultimately canned, but not for straying away from the foundations of the series. Instead, this version of Half-Life 3 suffered from development issues with Valve's Source Engine 2, which made development challenging. Source 2 was missing features such as lighting, save functionality, and visibility options, which compounded with the difficulty of modelling outdoor areas in an engine more suited to blocky interior ones.

       "Of course, Half-Life eventually did return, but not until 2020. Half-Life: Alyx isn't a structural departure from previous entries in the series, but the decision to make it a VR exclusive was a way for Valve to try something new with its gameplay.

       "“The typical console gamer buys just a few full games per year, and so while a $10 price hike may reduce demand at the margins, I also suspect that more gamers will instead just wait until the price drops either on packaged games or on the digital stores to $60 or $50.” said Ward. “So the main effect may be to push out sales to a later date for a portion of gamers with limited spending power.”\n",

The balance definitely felt off in solo play thanks to the abandonment of skill-based matchmaking, with no new system to replace the old flawed one. Still, Iron Banner keeps you constantly working toward a goal by rewarding you with a Pinnacle drop simply for playing, win or lose. Hey, if the player population hasn’t suffered as a result of the matchmaking changes, it can’t be that bad, right?\n",

       "Another cherished PVP event is Trials of Osiris, but it needs a ton of work on PC right now. This is a mode for the top echelon of players in which they claim a card that tracks wins and losses before fighting in 3v3 battles in the hopes of getting a string of seven consecutive victories. Do this and you’ll get to see the location known as The Lighthouse where you’ll be showered with loot. The catch is that Trials of Osiris is matchmade based on your connection strength as well as your card-state, and it’s simply not working.\n",
       "\n",
       "Playing on PC, it seems to me that the problem is that the pool is so full of either near-professional level players carrying a friend to The Lighthouse, or “account recoveries” – services where you can pay a high-skill player to play on your lower skill level account to get your character some wins. These groups join forces to wipe the floor with most players, and that combined with the prevalence of hackers on PC – which forces you to doubt whether you were the victim of a great shot or if someone’s 94% headshot accuracy is a bit suspect – have made it so that Trials of Osiris is just not fun.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bungie did announce that it’s working on an anti-cheat system this last month, but no word yet on when it will be deployed. Likewise, even though the recovery services are potentially against the terms of service they’re currently are so prolific that I don’t think a week has gone by that I haven’t been delivered an ad for one of them across various websites and social media services, and I haven’t seen Bungie take any action to shut them down.\n",

       "\n",
       "Cheaters and shady businesses aside, the main problem that gets in the way of my enjoyment are those near-professional-level players being mixed in with the general population and slaughtering everybody with impunity. To give you an idea of what you’re up against on PC, there are players who can slide forward while also somehow moving backwards, fly through the air like Peter Pan and hit every headshot before Warlock dashing away to safety, or simply nail every single headshot with what seems like inhuman reaction times when swiping 90% to land that snipe. As the community would put it, it’s “sweaty.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Sometimes I’ll see teams like this on their third or fourth run to The Lighthouse stomping my team out midway through a respectable run. It is exhausting to be having a series of great (and close) games only to be crushed in a 5 - 0 game where you're clearly outmatched, or faced against straight-up cheaters who are under-leveled but still hitting every sniper headshot. Needing to play at a level that’s nearly unfathomable to most PVP players makes Trials feel insurmountable. So they may choose to stop playing, leading to even higher proportions of pro-level players, account recovery players, or hackers in the pool for the rest of us to play against, meaning I’ll probably never get that coveted Warlock helmet.\n",
       "\n",
       "I didn’t have a lot of answers on how to fix this, but while complaining (yet again) about my latest Destiny 2 woes over the weekend a Reddit thread was brought to my attention with several great ideas from u/TheCommunityDiaries. The tl;dr version is that card-based matchmaking simply isn’t working – and I think they’re right.\n",
       "\n",
       "Loading\n",
       "\n",
       "What they propose is something they refer to as \"hand-based matchmaking\" which would mean you wouldn't go up against a team with several Lighthouse runs on their card if you’re struggling to hit your third-win, non-Lighthouse victory. This would alleviate a lot of the problems and create separate “pools” of players, meaning the more time that went by over the weekend, the better your chances would be. Currently, even high-level players like Aztecross are choosing to hop in on Fridays because the pool is bigger and you have a chance when the odds are stacked against you. The Redditor also brings up the idea of a Freelance playlist for Trials, something I would adore – as this currently exists for the Glory playlist, where you’re still paired with and against people at your skill level. The argument against matchmaking of this type in Destiny 2 was made irrelevant, in my opinion, given the tremendous success of the Freelance option. I’d love to see this for all Nightfalls, and yes, even for Raids – but that’s for another article.\n",
       "\n",
       "I’m a big advocate for close games that I have a chance of winning, but putting me up against Gigz’s team from 100 Thieves (yes, this has actually happened to me in the early days of Destiny 2) is not fair. I lose. No contest. However, putting me against a team where we go 4-4 and I end up losing is something I can live with. To me, that means the system is working because we got close, and I still have hope of getting to that coveted destination if I keep trying. No matter what Bungie changes, I hope they take a look at the current systems in place and keep refining what’s working and what isn’t. Iron Banner seems to be working, but maybe not for the right reasons, and I think Bungie knows that Trials needs some time on the workbench – especially for the PC players.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, I want to make one thing clear: I am in no way advocating bringing the current structure of skill-based matchmaking into the Trials of Osiris or Iron Banner playlist. The current version of SBMM in Destiny 2 has its own set of flaws, and there’s a reason it was dropped. Instead, I think that each mode needs unique considerations for how matchmaking should work within their unique structures. For example, Iron Banner should not pit solo players against a premade team of six. And Trials of Osiris needs a little more nuance and care with how teams are paired.\n",
       "\n",
       "Even with all of that said, Trials is still one of my favorite game modes of all time. It’s not in a great spot right now, but when it launched in the original Destiny on PS4 and Xbox I said that it redefined PVP. It came out at a time before battle royales existed, and offered an experience unlike any other. While the PVP space in games has evolved, I still think Bungie has that secret recipe that it’s constantly working to perfect. Just like games have evolved, I think the backend matchmaking aspect of Trials needs to do the same. Here’s hoping we’re only one patch away from bringing the competitive PVP space on PC back inline.</td><td>Destin Legarie</td><td>technology</td><td>Destiny 2's PVP population is booming, but it's matchmaking structure needs some improvements.</td><td>2020-07-10T18:37:15Z</td><td>Map(name -> IGN, id -> ign)</td><td>Destiny 2: Has a Huge PVP Population, but Matchmaking Needs Modernization - IGN</td><td>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-has-a-huge-pvp-population-but-matchmaking-needs-modernization</td><td>https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2020/07/10/pvpthumbign-1594407028275.jpg?width=1280</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product.

       "Heritage Auctions video game specialist and consignment director Valarie McLeckie, who helped shepherd this record sale, tells Ars that this “3-code variant” of Super Mario Bros. dates back to mid-1987. That makes it “slightly more attainable to find” than the very earliest test-market editions of the game, from late 1985 and early 1986, which were only sealed with a small circular Nintendo sticker (the earlier $100,000 sale came from that earliest batch). That also means it’s not among the very first shrink-wrapped copies of the game, which date back to mid-1986.\n",

       "Still, the fact that this copy of the game features a cardboard hangtab inside that shrink-wrap, “speaks to a level of vintage” that puts it in a rarefied class. “I would suspect sealed cardboard hangtab copies [still available today] number in the single digits,” McLeckie said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Remaining copies that are in good enough condition to earn a Wata Games certified rating of 9.4 out of 10, as this one was, are even rarer. “In this grade especially, it’s quite an impressive piece,” McLeckie said.\n",
       "\n",
       "“Strangely, the addition of the plastic wrap came before the box cutting die was altered to remove the cardboard hangtab,” as the Heritage Auction site points out. “This rendered the functionality of the cardboard hangtab completely useless, since it was under the plastic seal.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Considering this game was printed from late ‘85 until the early ‘90s, the number of [mid-‘80s] cardboard hangtab copies to those later ‘90s copies are very few and far between,” McLeckie told Ars. “Most of those earlier copies were purchased and opened, because they were closer to the time of the game’s release.”\n",

Whoever had it was lucky enough to keep it in a safe space.”\n",

But then another sealed hangtab copy of Super Mario Bros. sold for $40,200 despite a Wata rating of just 8.0. “So... I was like, ‘Well, if an 8.0 sold for that, I wouldn’t be too surprised if this one sold for six figures.’ But I was trying not to actively anticipate it.”\n",

Games for later systems have been bid up heavily as well; an early sealed copy of God of War for the PS2 sold for $2,640.\n",

       "“There’s a shift to what people are looking to add to their collections these days,” McLeckie continued.

Then they moved on to the next thing; people wanted to complete system sets. From that perspective, people are going to look for some games rather than others. The rarity factor played a much bigger role than it has been recently. I wouldn’t be surprised if [rarity] comes back around in importance the future.”\n",
       "\n",
       "With sealed game prices shooting up so quickly, some collectors and observers see the beginnings of a bubble developing in the market, and expect prices will come back down to more reasonable levels eventually. But McLeckie disagrees.\n",
       "\n",
       "“I fully believe that this is just as respectable a form of collectible as comics,” she said. “We’ve just now started to dip a toe into formalizing this market. By and large, people are just starting to tune into the fact that there is a rarity-based system involved.”\n",
       "\n",
       "“Things will change over time,” she continued. “Where we’ll see fluctuation, only time will tell. [But] I fully believe in the strength of this market. Video games have been solidified as an important piece of popular culture, and we all like to celebrate the beginnings of our favorite pastimes. I have no doubt that people will continue to do that.”\n",

       "The 'cropped' viewpoint of APS-C and Micro Four Thirds cameras can, for example, be a boon for wildlife and sports photography, as it lets you get the same angle of view with a smaller lens. For example, a 70-200mm lens on a full-frame camera becomes a 105-300mm lens on an APS-C model, which is ideal for wildlife snapping.\n",

       "Instead, it's fair to say that the full-frame boom, which will likely see the Canon EOS R6 soon followed by the Nikon Z5 and Sony A7S III, is partly being driven by fear of the smartphone.

       "This has knock-on effects for anyone who's looking to buy a camera in 2020. Because investing in a camera means buying into a system that will hopefully stick around for years or even decades – and the most likely ones to do that are relatively new mirrorless mounts like the Canon RF, Nikon Z and Sony E-Mount.\n",
       "\n",
       "The good thing about expensive flagships like the Canon EOS R6 and Canon EOS R5 is that they tend to make these new systems more affordable for everyone else. And this will likely turn out to be true for both cameras and lenses.\n",

       "Bargain hunting\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, the Canon EOS R – the camera that the EOS R6 and EOS R5 are heavily based on – is rumored to be dropping in price to $1,499 (around £1,185 / AU$2,185, without tax) by the end of September.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the EOS R isn't without its limitations (for example, there's only has one card slot and no AF joystick), it did launch for $2,299 / £2,349 / AU$3,250 in September 2018, making it a good option for those looking to start a future-proofed RF lens collection.\n",
       "\n",
       "Offering even better value is the Canon EOS RP, which is currently cheaper than many APS-C cameras or even compacts like the Sony RX100 Mark VII.\n",

       "The arrival of the Canon EOS R6 (third from right) could mean that earlier RF-mount models like the Canon EOS R (second from right) and EOS RP (left) could become even more affordable ways to get into the RF system. (Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "How closely related is the rumored Canon EOS R price drop to the arrival of the Canon EOS R6? That's up for debate. But what's more certain is that many current EOS R owners will soon be looking to sell in order to upgrade to Canon's latest model. And that will mean even better second-hand prices for some powerful full-frame mirrorless cameras that use the same mount as the EOS R6.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of course, it might be tempting to look at the even lower prices of full-frame DSLRs like the Canon EOS 6D Mark II. But unless you already have existing EF glass, the more future-proofed option is likely to go for RF mount options like the Canon EOS R or Canon EOS RP.\n",
       "\n",
       "(Image credit: Future)\n",
       "\n",
       "Another promising development from the Canon EOS R6 launch was the arrival of some better-value RF lenses. For the non-professional shooters out there, the Canon RF 85mm f/2 Macro IS STM ($599 / £650, around AU$1,180) looks a solid new option for macros and portraits.\n",
       "\n",
       "And then there's that pair of slightly eccentric, but well-priced, ultra-telephotos: the Canon RF 600mm f/11 IS STM ($699 / £750, around AU$1,360) and RF 800mm f/11 IS STM ($899 / £980 (around AU$1,775).\n",

       "\n",
       "The competition between Canon, Nikon, Sony and Panasonic is white-hot, and full-frame is becoming increasingly popular among hobbyist photographers.

       "The final barrier is price. With new models like the Canon EOS R6 putting extra pressure on more affordable full-frame cameras, and encouraging the growth of an RF lens system with more widespread appeal, it could soon become a great year to switch to full-frame mirrorless.

All of the marketing and advertising around the console, controller, and even the newly revealed PS5 game case design has featured black, white, and blue. While it’s not out of the question to see alternate colors and special editions release at some point, it’s unlikely to be at launch, especially with supply already reported to be somewhat constrained. Sony is going to stick with a singular unified design branding for now.\n",

The original poster did clarify with additional information (and a full image of the advert) that this is for an in-store promo for sales reps to sell items. I’m rather familiar with these having previously worked for a major music gear retailer. Top sales are entered into drawings for prizes, and apparently here, one of those prizes is a PS5.\n",

It doesn’t have the best HDR in the business, nor does it deliver the highest level of detail. And though they vary in size and capabilities, we endeavored to create testing categories that would make for a fair comparison. We ran the TVs through the setup process and tested all the features and options, such as picture modes, availability of specific services (like casting support) and how easy it was to navigate the interface.

Instructions that required fewer steps, or were easy to visually interpret, scored better. We preferred a balance between lighter materials, which made setup easier, and quality plastics and metals. During various programs, we noted colorful lights and surfaces in order to contrast these hues between the TVs. Low: We listened for the clarity and depth of sounds on the lower range, such as bass, drums, deeper instrumentals and vocals. We took note of any artifacts, such as crackling or buzzing, that can accompany such sounds. We noted any common artifacts such as poor volume balancing or screeching when notes get too high.

       "With models starting at $599.99 for a 55-inch, the TCL 6-Series might give you reverse sticker shock considering everything you get for that relatively small price tag. But can a 4K smart TV with so many specification standards really deliver a good picture for $500? The short answer: a resounding yes. The TCL 6-Series produces a vibrant picture with flexible customization options and handles both HDR and Dolby Vision, optimization standards that improve the content you’re watching by adding depth to details and expanding the color spectrum.\n",
       "\n",
       "For those willing and able to spend top dollar, the Sony A8H, a 2020 OLED TV, delivers a vibrant and strong picture with deep blacks and a sleek build. Though it starts at $1,898 for a 55-inch model (the 65-inch is $2,798), you’re getting an OLED, which means the panel is made up of pixels that individually emit a color to create a sharper image. The Sony A8H boasts a broad range of colors, from glowing brights to subtle pastels, and pitch-dark blacks. It supports an array of picture standards that automatically upscale and improve the quality of content, and the result is an exceptionally vibrant and detailed picture.\n",

       "With so many sub-$500 options, the budget category was crammed with competition. Ultimately, the $379.99 (on sale for $339.99) Vizio V-Series 55-inch TV performed best in our testing. The device is 4K HDR-capable and supports easy ways to send content from your phone to the big screen (Google Cast and AirPlay 2).

       "One of the best things about the TCL 6-Series is that it’s a Roku TV, so you get access to thousands of streaming services out of the box. You don’t need a treasure map to find the content, either. The main interface is a simple three-box-wide grid and a list on the side that acts as a quick settings menu. Your inputs (like HDMIs and antennas) appear as boxes on the grid, beside the boxes for the streaming services and apps you choose to add, allowing for quick switching. The interface can get clunky as your list of services and apps grows, but you can organize and arrange them — as a grid or list — however you like, to make it easier to find what you’re looking for.\n",

       "The TCL 6-Series’ Roku interface enables both browsing and searching for services from the left nav. Netflix, Disney+, YouTube, Hulu, Apple TV+, Sling, AT&T TV, YouTube TV, Philo, Google Play, ESPN and most other streaming services are available. You’ll need an account for full access to them, but once you’re set up, you just log in once from the TV (authenticate using a computer or phone, if asked) and you’re in. As more channels and services are released for Roku, your TV will be automatically updated.\n",
       "\n",
       "Casting content to the 6-Series from your phone is also simple, and you can do so with several services, including Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. As long as you’re on the same Wi-Fi network, the 6-Series will automatically show up within the cast menu for the app.\n",
       "\n",
       "And you don’t have to worry about all that content going to waste on a subpar screen. The TCL 6-Series’$2 4K UHD panel handles color reproduction quite well. During “Avengers: Endgame,” we were impressed with the vibrant and accurate colors of Captain America’s red, white and blue shield — not to mention that rugged green we know and love from The Hulk. Nothing was washed out or appeared dingy or oversaturated to a cartoonish degree.\n",
       "\n",
       "The TV also supports Dolby Vision HDR, HDR 10, CCZ Technology and a wide color gamut. This means that the TV can read embedded metadata to calibrate the picture in real-time so it appears closer to the creator’s intentions. Overall, it delivers accuracy in color reproduction and contrast, and displays a mastery of both brights and darks.\n",
       "\n",
       "When we watched “Springsteen on Broadway” streamed over Netflix in Dolby Vision, the detail presented — from the pores on Bruce’s face to the wood texture on his guitar — was second to none. Even dimly lit props in the background were easy to distinguish. The lighting during “The Rising,” which depicts Springsteen in a bold silhouette, was a real test of how this LED panel handles deep blacks next to a brighter pop of light. When Springsteen was dimly lit from behind against a black background, the TCL was able to contrast the darker areas with crisp highlights, all without any details getting washed out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Audio quality on the 6-Series is a little underwhelming; we found it too easy, for instance, for the mix to get muddied, with vocals meshing together alongside background ambiance. We definitely recommend pairing the 6-Series with a soundbar or home theater system. That said, it’s true across the board that as TVs have slimmed down, so has the built-in sound quality, and we’d recommend adding external speakers to any of the TVs on this list.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the price, the TCL 6-Series is a highly capable 4K UHD TV that has the chops to deliver meaningful HDR content improvements — including increased brightness and additional emphasis on colors. It’s a massive 65-inch panel big enough to fill most spaces for well under $800. Plus, we can’t praise the Roku TV platform enough. We’re confident recommending the TCL 6-Series as a tremendous value and the best option for most people.\n",

       "\n",
       "Buying an OLED means you’re paying for a premium picture quality that delivers breathtaking vibrant colors and deep blacks, and that’s certainly what you get with the Sony A8H, which narrowly out-performed LG’s CX 55 and provides more value than Samsung’s 8K QLED Q800T.\n",
       "\n",
       "This panel produces hyper-accurate colors in immense detail, in part thanks to Sony’s flagship X1 Ultimate processor. This technology optimizes whatever you’re watching in real-time, upscales content to 4K ultra high-definition, and allows you to take advantage of standards like HDR or Dolby Vision. It’s the same basic metadata reproduction that TCL features on the 6-Series, but Sony has a leg up since many of the cameras and displays on TV and film sets are made by them. Thanks to this, they have a large backlog of content that they’ve run AI through to determine the best way to calibrate a TV for a dog, or a fiery explosion or even a cityscape. The A8H taps into this knowledge and uses the processor to calibrate the panel and optimize the image. All that to say: Sony is really superior when it comes to producing the best image on a TV.\n",
       "\n",
       "This shone through during our testing. With an episode from the first season of “The Simpsons,” compared to some of the other TVs we tested, there was noticeably less fuzziness around the characters, and the picture maintained a realistic balance in vibrance and color.\n",
       "\n",
       "With both animation and live action, the A8H optimizes in real-time for a highly accurate experience. Take “Captain Marvel,” when (spoiler alert) she ends up defeating the villain by breaking free with a burst of solar energy. The A8H didn’t produce added noise to the graphics — the solar burst didn’t look unnatural and ultimately fit in with the universe around it. Yes, the animation came with high vibrancy, but not so much that it washed out the rest of the frame. This is a trait of the OLED panel, which can make minute changes on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and Sony’s technology optimizes it well on the A8H.\n",
       "\n",
       "Working on top of this is Dolby Vision, for content that supports it. Essentially, instructions are embedded in the visuals for the best way the A8H can present the content. Similarly to HDR, Dolby Vision will highlight colors and deliver stronger contrast. With content that doesn’t support Dolby Vision, we found ourselves using the Vivid picture mode, which provides the highest amount of brightness. Most importantly, it doesn’t reduce sharpness or add graininess. That’s a big positive.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sony opted for a custom version of Android TV for the A8H interface. This offers access to a ton of streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+, Hulu and YouTube, although Android TV is more limited than Roku’s platform. Of course you can always expand that library by adding a streaming box, like a Roku Ultra or Apple TV 4K.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Android TV platform also means you can control the A8H with Google Assistant and ask for content or adjust a setting with voice commands. Simply hold the button on the remote and tell it to open Netflix, or get more specific and request your favorite YouTube channel.\n",
       "\n",
       "For those in the Apple ecosystem, the A8H supports AirPlay 2 for casting content from your iOS, iPadOS, macOS or watchOS device. It also works with Amazon Alexa, but the controls are limited to basic commands like turning the TV on and off and controlling playback. It’s nice to have, but since this is Android TV, the deepest integration by far is with Google Assistant.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the sound front, there isn’t space for the usual speakers at the bottom of the TV —- facing forward or downward —- like on LED or QLED TVs. On the A8H, the sound comes from the screen, through two actuators that vibrate to create it. It’s rather impressive and delivers an immersive experience, though we still recommend a soundbar or home theater setup.\n",
       "\n",
       "The A8H packs all that tech into a really slim package — almost to a jaw-dropping degree, especially if you’ve never seen an OLED TV. At its thinnest point the A8H is just a quarter of an inch thick, while most TVs span at least two inches thick.\n",
       "\n",
       "All in all, an OLED delivers what might just be the best picture on the market. You get incredibly deep blacks (if you’re looking at the depths of the ocean, you feel as if you might get sucked in) and vibrant colors that will have you tasting rainbows. Sony’s A8H achieves all of this and pairs it with cinematic colors and blacks. You’re paying nearly $2,000 (or $3,000, depending on the size), but you’re getting a first-rate TV that you won’t have to think about upgrading for many years to come.\n",

       "While opting to pay less for a TV always comes with compromises (namely in picture quality compared with our other top picks), the 55-inch Vizio V-Series leaves relatively little to be desired at this price point. It doesn’t have the best HDR in the business, nor does it deliver the highest level of detail. But considering it starts at just $379.99 (on sale for $339.99), it’s a solid TV with an adequate interface that’s enjoyable to watch.\n",
       "\n",
       "The V-Series manages to produce a reasonably good display. Take that climactic scene from “Captain Marvel” we discussed above: The contrast between the brilliant solar burst and the darker background is quite nice on the V-Series, though the burst itself isn’t as vibrant when compared with the TCL 6-Series, or as detailed as on the A8H. Similarly, in “Avengers: Endgame,” when Thanos stands alone against the darkness of space, his outfit and skin are presented with considerable vibrancy on the V-Series, but the contrast, color and highlights on his shining armor aren’t depicted quite as accurately as they are on the higher-end models.\n",
       "\n",
       "With shows delivered at 720p or 1080p HD quality, like “Below Deck Mediterranean” and “90 Day Fiance,” the V-Series panel didn’t introduce extra noise or fuzziness when scaling up the content to higher quality.\n",

Our testing pool consisted of a mix of OLEDs, QLEDs and LED panels. QLEDs and LED panels are similar in that they both use a backlit panel that transmits light through filters containing pixels to create an image. An OLED is entirely different as it emits the image through individual pixels.\n",

       "\n",
       "Setup and instructions: As we set up the TV, we jotted down any grievances we had with the process. This included assembling any hardware, like the TV stand, to setting up software, such as Samsung Tizen or Roku TV. Instructions that required fewer steps, or were easy to visually interpret, scored better.\n",
       "\n",
       "Design and appeal\n",
       "\n",
       "Material design: We researched and inspected the materials from which the TV was constructed. We preferred a balance between lighter materials, which made setup easier, and quality plastics and metals.\n",
       "\n",
       "Bezels: We measured the ratio between bezels, or the frame around the display, and the display itself. A display that occupies a greater portion of the front of the TV was naturally preferred.\n",
       "\n",
       "Access to ports and buttons: We checked out how easy it was to plug in cables and access ports once the TV was set up. We also noted where buttons were located and how easily we could access them. (Buttons requiring yoga poses to reach them were scored poorly.)\n",

       "\n",
       "Soundstage: We noted the extent to which each TV could produce a sense of 3D sound. For example, if an instrument is on the far edge of a stage during a performance, a TV with good soundstage will authentically reproduce the position of the sound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Low: We listened for the clarity and depth of sounds on the lower range, such as bass, drums, deeper instrumentals and vocals. We took note of any artifacts, such as crackling or buzzing, that can accompany such sounds.\n",

Ryan Gorman, president and CEO of Coldwell Banker. \"There's an awareness of the risk of people coming into my space,\" says Kate Kaufmann, a writer in Portland, Oregon, who is selling her condominium. Kaufmann says neighbors are also jittery about having complete strangers enter the shared complex to view her property. Los Angeles-based realtor John Maseredjian says he's using video calls not just to show properties, but to handle other, more mundane aspects of real estate. Maseredjian, who is the co-owner of JohnHart Real Estate, says he relies on teleconferencing software like Zoom Video Communications and Verizon's Bluejeans to get face-to-face with clients during the pandemic. \"Where we used to meet people in the conference room of the office, we can share screens, go over data and analytics, things that we used to go over in person.\"\n",

       "The housing market was battered by Covid-19. Existing home sales experienced the largest decline since 1982 (when mortgage rates were 18%), but the worst may be over. Pending home sales bounced back for a record gain in May, while new home sales are starting to rebound as well, and more quickly than homebuilders expected. Properties are selling at a faster rate compared to the same time last year, and new contracts and new listings — while lower than a year ago — are easing in their rates of decline, according to the National Association of Realtors' weekly housing market monitor. The virtual walkthrough is accelerating the existing home search, with buyers winnowing down the list of potential properties faster than before. \"Rather than going and seeing 30 different homes in person, you can see them virtually,\" Maseredjian said. Redfin says it's seeing a rise in sellers using 3-D scans to create virtual walkthroughs that are \"almost like playing a video game,\" says Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman. Coldwell Banker has been using the augmented reality technology from Streem to prepare homes for showing without needing to send an agent to the physical property. These trends are reflected nationwide: a May survey conducted by the National Association of Realtors found that 35% of realtors are seeing sellers rely on virtual tours.\n",

       "While Microsoft has put its own first party offerings on Game Pass as a way to encourage players to flock to the Xbox ecosystem and the subscription service, getting big third party games, and big new games especially, is a whole other level.\n",
       "\n",
       "The equivalent example would be asking how much Netflix would be willing to pay Disney to have Avengers: Infinity War launch on its service instead of in theaters with people paying $15 a ticket. The answer is that it’s probably impossible. Netflix is not going to pay a billion dollars to make that happen, Disney is not going to agree to that for any less than that, and even that may be too low (in my example we’re pretending Disney Plus isn’t a thing).\n",
       "\n",
       "The point being, Cyberpunk is a such a sales draw that CDPR obviously wants as many people to pay $60 for a new copy as possible.

       "\n",
       "Game Pass, at this point, is already pretty much a must-have for anyone who owns an Xbox unless you want to inefficiently spend money on your library for the duration of a console generation. There’s just too much value there not to get it if you’re an Xbox player. Past that, this time around, Microsoft has promised Halo Infinite, its massive launch title and one of the biggest games of the year, will arrive on Game Pass on day one as a Series X launch title. That game alone is big enough where Cyberpunk just isn’t necessary.\n",

       "So in short, this deal makes sense for no one. CDPR would risk too much revenue loss by putting Cyberpunk on Game Pass, Microsoft would probably have to spend so much to secure it that it wouldn’t be worth the trouble. So expect to buy Cyberpunk like you would any other game for a long, long while.\n",

It can detect duplicate files, highlight the apps that are taking up the most space, remove downloads in one tap, and even recommend apps to uninstall based on how long you haven't used them. It's honestly one of the best storage cleanup apps on the Play Store, and because it's from Google, you know it's trustworthy and won't do anything weird to your phone.\n",

If your phone is running a recent version of Android, you can use a feature called Adoptable Storage to turn the SD card into an extension of the phone's internal storage, so you don't have to manually move apps and data to the SD card (Android handles it for you). However, this feature is disabled on some devices — it wasn't present on Samsung Galaxy phones until Android 9 Pie.\n",

       "\n",
       "Asked about playing the game on next-gen consoles via backward compatibility, Brian Hayes, the game’s creative director, said in a statement to Polygon that “presumably, fans will be able to play UFC 4 on their Gen 5 consoles,” as long as both the PS5 and Xbox Series X offer the feature. But he noted, “We haven’t yet had an opportunity to test this out and determine whether any additional development work is required to leverage Backward Compatibility.” The statement is strange, considering that the box art for the Xbox One version claims the game will be playable across both Xbox One and Xbox Series X via Smart Delivery.\n",
       "\n",
       "UFC 4 gameplay improvements\n",
       "\n",
       "Hayes and McDonald spent the rest of their presentation outlining the development team’s vision for UFC 4: a game that looks and feels more like real-life UFC action in the octagon, while taking more liberties outside of it. They said their overarching goal is to broaden the series’ appeal by making UFC 4 more accessible — a welcome change for the franchise, since we described 2018’s EA Sports UFC 3 in our review as “probably the least pick-up-and-play game in the sports genre.”\n",
       "\n",
       "Both McDonald and Hayes have been working on the EA Sports UFC series since the beginning, and their approach used to be inspired primarily by EA Sports’ famous, long-running tagline, “It’s in the game.” Hayes told Polygon, “We were always consistently going down [the path of] ‘how can we add more sim, more realism?’” This time around, they’re still focusing on delivering an authentic MMA gameplay experience in UFC 4, but “the broader game has kind of taken a bit of a pivot” away from the real-life UFC, according to Hayes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Much of the team’s new philosophy is driven by feedback from fans and critics. One of the main complaints with the previous games is that their control schemes were too complicated, especially for elements like submissions and grappling. In UFC 4, you simply tap buttons for quick, basic strikes and hold them for longer, more damaging (and/or more flashy) attacks. Buttons are also used for entering the clinch and attempting takedowns, instead of the analog sticks. “It is a lot easier on your fingers,” said Hayes.\n",
       "\n",
       "EA Vancouver has integrated the company’s Real Player Motion technology into UFC 4 for takedowns and clinch situations, which should increase the fluidity of animations for transitions and other movements. And if you were frustrated by missing the timing for blocking takedown attempts, the animation changes should also help in that area, because there are new movement-based ways to defend against or escape from takedowns.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the grappling front, the developers have added what Hayes referred to as “grappling controls for the rest of us.” The new left-stick scheme is simple: Push up to get up, left to start a submission, and right to mount your opponent and start pounding away. The complicated positional transitions of old are still available for hardcore series veterans, and there’s an in-between setting, “Hybrid,” that shows you which legacy controls apply to which left-stick move you’re doing — it’s a way to learn the transition controls.\n",
       "\n",
       "Submissions no longer rely on moving “break walls” with the right stick, as in UFC 3. There are two new submission minigames in UFC 4 that have you chase your opponent around the interface by using the triggers and sticks. The mechanics will be familiar to people who have played other wrestling and MMA games, and they’re “a lot less complicated to explain to your friend on the couch,” said Hayes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Career changes and other UFC 4 modes\n",
       "\n",
       "Along with player feedback, EA Vancouver relies on telemetry data that indicates how people actually played the previous entries in the EA Sports UFC franchise. It turned out that the career mode was easily the most popular mode, and that people strongly favored using created fighters rather than the real athletes on the roster. To that end, UFC 4 will take players straight into the career mode; it’s designed as an onboarding experience, with an opening sequence of four amateur fights that introduce players to boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, and jiujitsu.\n",
       "\n",
       "After that, UFC 4’s career mode will play out similarly to that of UFC 3, which was all about becoming the G.O.A.T. (the “greatest of all time”). We noted in our UFC 3 review that the career structure quickly became a repetitive grind, but perhaps the additions and updates will liven up the experience in UFC 4. Training is still a key component, but instead of playing minigames, you earn points to upgrade attributes, and you improve your skills just by sparring and fighting — the more you use a move, the better it gets. You can now choose to accept or decline fights, which will have consequences for your career development and your rivalries. And there’s now a full World Fighting Alliance minor league, where you can keep fighting for as long as you want before graduating to the UFC level.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since many people will play the career mode with a custom character, EA Vancouver has greatly expanded the customization options available when you’re creating a fighter. In addition to increased variability in body types and hair, the accessories now include all kinds of outlandish items like crowns, animal heads, and luchador masks; in addition, the tattoo creator is deeper than before. The goal, according to Hayes and McDonald, is to give players much more freedom in character design, so they’re not limited to the kinds of apparel you’d see real-life UFC fighters wear.\n",

       "It’s also worth noting that the customization items for created fighters are all cosmetic; they won’t affect gameplay. UFC 4 will offer microtransactions in the form of a premium currency that can be used to buy those items, but all of them can be unlocked by playing the game. And EA is trying to avoid any hint of the microtransaction kerfuffle around UFC 3 — that game’s Ultimate Team mode isn’t returning for UFC 4.\n",
       "\n",
       "EA Vancouver’s strategy of removing realism-based restrictions in UFC 4 extends to setting up fights. Offline exhibition matches have open weight classes, so you can create a bantamweight fighter and put them in the octagon against a light heavyweight. The game will scale everything accordingly to keep the fight fair.\n",

Most likely the project will dust off a machine somewhere in the cloud running Windows (likely using a free license generously provided by MS, btw) and setup some automated build processes to make these “in house”.

       "\n",
       "So coming to the specifications of the three parts, we are first going to talk about the two 64 core variants. These parts have the 100-000000114-07 and 100-000000114-09 OPN code with the A0 revision. The 64 core parts are based on an 8+1 die configuration (8 Zen 3 CCDs and 1 I/O die). The chips offer 64 cores, 128 threads, 2 MB of L1 cache, 32 MB of L2 cache, and 256 MB of L3 cache but each Zen 3 CCD has access to a larger pool of L3 cache since the CCX is now a singular unit with 8 cores rather than splitting it into two 4+4 configurations. This way, the CCD can access the whole 32 MB of L3 cache rather than the share 16+16 MB L3 cache on the previous generation EPYC CPUs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two variants feature variable clock speeds of 3.0 GHz at max and 1.2 GHz at the lowest P2 state but these are early samples and final variants are expected to feature clock speeds of up to 3.4GHz which are the same as the EPYC 7742 (EPYC Rome) CPU and may suggest that AMD is relying on the new architecture and process node to deliver performance/efficiency gains rather than focusing at higher clock speeds. Both 64 core parts at rated at 225W with a maximum TDP of 240W.\n",

       "The other variant is the 100-000000117-03 which features 32 cores and 64 threads. This chip has a total of 1 MB of L1 cache, 16 MB of L2 cache, & 128 MB of L3 cache. The chip also comes with a 4+1 die configuration. The CPU features a maximum frequency of 3.00 GHz in its ES state and has a TDP of 180W (200W cTDP up).

       "AMD has so far confirmed themselves that Zen 3 brings a brand new CPU architecture, which helps deliver significant IPC gains, faster clocks, and even higher core counts than before. Some rumors have even pointed to a 17% increase in IPC and a 50% increase in Zen 3's floating-point operations along with a major cache redesign.\n",

       "When asked about what kind of performance gain Milan's CPU core microarchitecture, which is known as Zen 3, will deliver relative to the Zen 2 microarchitecture that Rome relies on in terms of instructions processed per CPU clock cycle (IPC), Norrod observed that -- unlike Zen 2, which was more of an evolution of the Zen microarchitecture that powers first-gen Epyc CPUs -- Zen 3 will be based on a completely new architecture. Norrod did qualify his remarks by pointing out that Zen 2 delivered a bigger IPC gain than what's normal for an evolutionary upgrade -- AMD has said it's about 15% on average -- since it implemented some ideas that AMD originally had for Zen but had to leave on the cutting board. However, he also asserted that Zen 3 will deliver performance gains \"right in line with what you would expect from an entirely new architecture.\" - The Street\n",

As for the new features, other than featuring its Zen 3 core design, Milan would offer socket compatibility with SP3 platforms, would feature support for DDR4 memory, PCIe 4.0 interface, and is stated to offer 64 cores and 2x the threads (128 threads). The chips will have a TDP rated at 120-225W which is similar to existing Rome parts.\n",

       "\"I was definitely making my options,\" says the actress Sandra Oh on The Hollywood Reporter's Awards Chatter podcast as we discuss the years between the end of her decade-long run on ABC's Grey's Anatomy in 2014 and her casting on BBC America's Killing Eve. Coming off of Grey's, a hit medical drama series that had brought her five Emmy nominations for her portrayal of intern-turned-surgeon Cristy Yang, Oh hoped that she had moved up in \"hierarchy of opportunity\" in Hollywood — but she was heartbroken to discover that \"that wasn't the case for years.\" Indeed, it wasn't until mid-2017 that another truly exciting screen opportunity came around: a pilot script written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge for a show called Killing Eve. Conditioned to being considered only for supporting parts, Oh read through it trying to figure out which character she was wanted for — until her agent told her that it was the titular one, an MI6 agent obsessively pursuing a psychopathic assassin named Villanelle.

       "Oh was born and raised near Ottawa, one of three children of Korean immigrants. She was an avid dancer throughout her childhood, but when she was 10 her older sister encouraged her to audition for a school play and, she says, \"That's when everything changed.\" Oh was landing professional jobs by 15, and would shortly thereafter turn down a journalism scholarship in order to attend the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal, landing paying jobs of various sizes along the way. \"In Canada it's very, very different,\" she explains, \"because multi-culturalism is very much mandated, so I really, really benefited from that during my teen years, because there needed to be representation.\" Upon her graduation, she was quickly cast as the lead of a high-profile short film, feature film and TV film in Canada. \"I knew what was possible because I got it from the very beginning,\" she muses, before deadpanning, \"Then I moved to Hollywood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Soon after arriving in the showbiz capital in 1995, Oh had a \"very, very, very painful\" encounter with an agent who communicated to her that she would find no opportunities in America and should go back to Canada. \"I think it's taken me a long time to unravel from something like that,\" she acknowledges a quarter-century later. But, despite that messaging, she soon landed the part of a spunky assistant to a sports agent on the HBO comedy series Arli$$, on which she appeared from 1996 through 2002. Robert Wuhl, the show's star, chose her, and, she says, \"I will always be forever grateful to him\" for an experience on which she \"learned so much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Outside of and after Arli$$, Oh pursued work in films, and appeared in a number of them that found large audiences and/or were well received, such as Garry Marshall's The Princess Diaries in 2001, Audrey Wells' Under the Tuscan Sun in 2003 and Oh's then-husband Alexander Payne's Sideways in 2004 (which was nominated for the best picture Oscar and was awarded the best ensemble SAG Award). But, in focusing on film opportunities, Oh found that she was working less and less — as she once put it, \"I'd hit the glass ceiling of playing the best friend.\" And so she decided to try to return to television.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fortunately enough, shortly before the release of Sideways, Oh was sent Shonda Rhimes' pilot for Grey's Anatomy. She initially was approached about playing Dr. Miranda Bailey, Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital's resident supervisor (Chandra Wilson was ultimately cast in the part), but instead wound up playing Cristina Yang. \"She was really tough, and I liked her acerbicness and spikiness,\" Oh says, noting that she relished the rare opportunity to develop a character over an extended period of time. At the end of the show's 10th season, however, Oh felt it was time to move on. Around then, Rhimes said of her, \"One of the greatest gifts of my creative life has been the opportunity to write words to be spoken by Sandra Oh. The reason is simple: Sandra Oh is a virtuoso. She treats dialogue like notes of music — every word must be played, every syllable correctly toned. She’s always been an extraordinary actor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And then, eventually, came Killing Eve, on which Oh not only stars — opposite her \"great dance partner\" Jodie Comer, in a cat and mouse game unlike anything seen on television before — but also serves as an EP. For her performance, Oh has already won best actress in a drama series Critics' Choice, Golden Globe and SAG awards, and has received two Emmy nominations in the same category, as well, the first of which, in 2018, made her the first woman of Asian descent ever to be nominated for that top acting honor. On the heels of its third season, Oh says, \"I have found shooting this show extremely creatively challenging for me, in the best of ways and in ways that have challenged me the most. In the darkest places I have had to go, it hasn't been easy. But the fact that people enjoy it?\" For that, she could be more grateful.</td><td>Scott Feinberg</td><td>technology</td><td>The first woman of Asian descent ever nominated for the best drama actress Emmy reflects on race and affirmative action, why she gave up on film and spent a decade on 'Grey's Anatomy' and how, only years later, her first lead in a major project came about.</td><td>2020-07-11T19:51:00Z</td><td>Map(name -> Hollywood Reporter, id -> null)</td><td>'Awards Chatter' Podcast — Sandra Oh ('Killing Eve') - MSN Money</td><td>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/awards-chatter-podcast-sandra-oh-killing-eve-1302822</td><td>https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/06/sandra_oh.jpg</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EAST LANSING, Mich. – Ingham County health officials say a total of 185 coronavirus (COVID-19) cases are now tied to an outbreak at a bar in East Lansing as of Saturday evening.

       "\n",
       "It's a race against time\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the only approved treatments for SMA is Zolgensma, which replaces a working copy of the gene into those nerve cells before they die and symptoms develop. While the US FDA approved treatment is not yet approved in Canada, it is available in multiple countries, including the US.\n",
       "\n",
       "This potentially lifesaving treatment, administered as a one-time infusion into a vein, comes with the hefty price tag of $2.125 million, or around $2.9 million in Canadian dollars. The family is trying to raise $3 million Canadian dollars.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Gene therapies such as Zolgensma have the potential to reduce the financial burden on patients, families and the overall healthcare system by replacing repeat, lifetime therapies with a single treatment,\" a spokesperson for AveXis, the company that markets Zolgensma, told CNN.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As a single, one-time intravenous infusion, Zolgensma's price in the countries where it has been approved reflects the long-term value it brings. Zolgensma is priced in the U.S. at approximately 50% less than the current 10-year cost of chronic SMA therapy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Health Canada, the government department that sets the country's health policy, did not respond to CNN's request for comment on its stance on Zolgensma.\n",

       "So far, more than 500 patients have been treated with Zolgensma, according to the AveXis spokesperson. Data from clinical trials presented by AveXis showed \"rapid, significant, clinically meaningful benefit in SMA including prolonged event-free survival, motor milestone achievement and durability,\" the spokesperson added.\n",
       "\n",
       "Zolgensma alters the patient's biology -- but it's still not a guaranteed cure. While this may be one of Lucy's only chances to live past two years, Van Doormaal said the cost of Zolgensma is overwhelming, and without help they simply will not be able to pay for it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They have put a price tag on my daughter's life, and that's extremely difficult to digest,\" she said.\n",

       "Spinraza usually costs approximately $750,000 for the first year and $375,000 for subsequent years for the rest of the patient's life, but the medication is completely covered by Lucy's health insurance in Canada, Van Doormaal said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Until Lucy receives Zolgensma, if she is able to, her family and neurologist will not know for sure if she will need to continue using Spinraza for life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since SMA results in severe respiratory issues, Lucy sleeps hooked up to a BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machine, a non-invasive ventilator, to help her breathe. Her family also uses an oximeter to monitor her pulse and blood oxygen levels.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because Lucy has also has lost the ability to feed on her own through her mouth, she has undergone surgery to get a gastrostomy tube placed to allow her family to feed her through it.\n",

       "\n",
       "As babies with SMA grow up, their symptoms quickly worsen -- and the damage is permanent. Until they receive a potentially lifesaving gene therapy treatment like Zolgensma, their respiratory issues and muscle weakness will only aggravate.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's critical she gets the (treatment) as soon as possible,\" Van Doormaal said. \"It won't be able to reverse any damage that's being done to her right now, but it will give her the gene she needs to live.\"\n",

Perhaps even more crucially, the report goes into great length about a combined culture of constant harassment, frequent plying of alcohol, and an HR system that resisted reports of sexual harassment.

They call it a 'witch hunt.' On top of everything, as women, we became a threat.\" The article describes other hostile conditions enabled by Ubisoft HR, particularly a definition of workplace harassment that was updated in 2015 to remove the example of a manager sexually harassing a reporting employee.
