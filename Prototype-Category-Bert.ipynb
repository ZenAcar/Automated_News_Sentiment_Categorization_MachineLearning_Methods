Gilead published a report on Friday saying that its antiviral drug remdesivir showed that it reduced the risk of death for coronavirus patients by 62% compared with standard care alone. The findings are being presented at the Virtual Covid-19 Conference as part of the 23rd International AIDS Conference, the company said.\",\"4\":\"After the Federal Reserve announced it would be capping bank dividends as a result of its annual stress testing, Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) said it would trim its current payout of $0.51 per common share in the third quarter. The company said it would announce its new dividend when it reports its second-quarter earnings on July 14.\\n\\nThe big question is, how low will that dividend go?\\n\\nCalculating the dividend\\n\\nFor at least the third quarter, the Fed will be limiting banks' dividends to the level of their average net income over the past four quarters (although banks are not allowed to raise the dividend over what they paid out in the second quarter). So the big unknown for now is second-quarter earnings. Here's where Wells Fargo stands going into its second-quarter report next week:\\n\\nQuarter Net Income (millions) Q319 $4,610 Q419 $2,873 Q120 $653 Q220 ???\\n\\nThe $653 million Wells Fargo reported in the first quarter came to just $0.01 per share. One reason for the small amount was the billions Wells Fargo set aside to cover potential loan losses; another was the bank's inability to generate significant profits. It's difficult for Wells Fargo to expand its balance sheet because it's right up against the $1.95 trillion asset cap the Fed placed on it in early 2018 following its fake-account scandal. Even though Wells Fargo participated in the Paycheck Protection Program, it will have to forfeit any fees it makes to the Federal Reserve, so it is looking at another quarter of small profits and a high loan loss provision.\\n\\nAccording to Yahoo! Finance, the consensus among 24 analysts is that Wells Fargo will report a loss of $0.07 earnings per share in the second quarter. I am also going to assume shares outstanding will be unchanged from the first quarter at about 4.1 billion, because the Fed has also suspended stock buybacks. Using these numbers, Wells Fargo would report a loss of about $300 million in the second quarter.\\n\\nQuarter Net Income (millions) Q319 $4,610 Q419 $2,873 Q120 $653 Q220 ($300) (estimate) Average Net Income $1,959\\n\\nBased on this assumption, Wells Fargo would be able to allocate $1.959 billion to dividends in the quarter. That's already below the $2.4 billion the bank paid out in total dividends in the first quarter of 2020. But before any dividends can go to common shareholders, the company must pay its preferred stockholders. Preferred dividends in Q1 were $339 million. Assuming the same amount in the second quarter, the total amount of net income applicable to common shareholders would be roughly $1.62 billion.\\n\\nWith 4.1 billion of average common shares outstanding, that's a common dividend of about $0.40 per share, or a roughly 22% reduction from the common dividend paid out in the first quarter.\\n\\nLots of variables\\n\\nI would caution that there are several variables that impact this projection. For one, there is a wide range of forecasts regarding Wells Fargo's Q2 earnings. While the consensus is a loss of $0.07 per share, the low estimate is a loss of $0.61 per share, while the top estimate is a gain of $0.43 per share, which seems absurdly high, but you never know. One investor following Wells Fargo says investors should brace for a worst-case scenario of a 50% dividend reduction.\\n\\nThe preferred dividend amount paid out could also change slightly, as could the number of outstanding shares, which would impact the final common dividend. Or perhaps Wells Fargo decides not to issue the full allowable amount -- although I see this as unlikely, considering the bank's limited ability to generate profits and the value that investors have always placed in the company's high dividend yield. I believe a good estimate is a reduced dividend by about a quarter, but that is heavily dependent on how much the company announces in earnings on July 14.\",\"5\":\"Dublin, July 10, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \\\"Global Public Cloud Market By Organization Size, By Services Type, By End User, By Region, Industry Analysis and Forecast, 2020 - 2026\\\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Global Public Cloud Market size is expected to reach $488.5 billion by 2026, rising at a market growth of 16% CAGR during the forecast period. The public cloud is where the vendor can provide companies with access to their data center infrastructure. They are responsible for all management, repair, security and upgrades. Cloud computing has developed into a large and diverse network of technologies, products and services. Giving birth to a multi-billion-dollar ecosystem in which multiple service vendors compete for ever-expanding cloud market share. As consumers, it is difficult to access and appreciate this cloud ecosystem.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe decision of a business to move to the cloud is unique. Nonetheless, there are some common explanations and inevitable developments that cause a company to make a transition. One of the most important reasons for change is the wide range of benefits provided by cloud computing. Greater durability, scalability, and stability are only a couple of the most common explanations for this. Data compliance is the backbone of corporate practices whether you're in sectors such as financial services and healthcare. If a company operates on on-site solutions, the development and continued implementation of compliance regulations may pose a significant resource challenge. Moving to the cloud helps to select which providers are already compatible. These compliance requirements will be updated with the cloud vendor responsible for any updates.\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the coming years, a number of industry watchers are speculating about what the recent stagnation in growth is expected to mean for the public cloud market share. This has been commonly demonstrated in many economies, it is a truism that growth rates should collapse this hyper-scale is reached. However, even with the overall decline in production, almost every other sector of the broader technology industry is still exceeded. Coronavirus has forced the majority of IT firms to follow the home model of operation. IT and ITES have made it easier for mobile staff to implement business productivity technologies and services. As a result, there is a growing need for cloud connectivity and collaboration tools across the globe.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe major strategies followed by the market participants are Partnerships.

You don't want to add to it here because it's unclear how long it will be until park revenue comes back to a normalized level, but you don't want to sell it\\\" because it remains more attractive than other media companies, said David Mazza, a managing direction at Direxion.\\n\\nDisney did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nShares of the company are down 8.3% over the last month, compared with a 2.3% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time, and have fallen 19.1% since the beginning of January. Despite those declines, Disney trades at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 43.8, just below its 52-week high of 47.8. Its P\\/E fell to a 52-week low of 14 on March 23 after beginning the year near 22.\\n\\nMuch of the gains in valuation have come from renewed investor attention to Disney Plus, which has attracted more than 50 million subscribers since launching in November. That growth, however, will likely not make up for the hit from the decline in the parks division.\\n\\n\\\"The economic recession plus the need for social distancing, new health precautions, the lack of travel and crowd aversion are likely to make this business less profitable until there is a widely available vaccine,\\\" analysts at UBS noted. They project that earnings before interest and taxes in the parks division will fall by approximately $500 million in this fiscal year and $200 million the next, compared with a $6.8 billion gain in fiscal 2019.\\n\\nBill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Funds, said his firm has been reducing its position in Disney because the shares look over-valued at a time when its parks division will be limited and its ESPN and ABC segments are suffering from severe cutbacks in professional sports.\\n\\n\\\"A lot of the benefit you'd get from the return to full speed of parks and the return to full speed to professional sports is going to get ruined by a P\\/E contraction\\\" once investor euphoria over the launch of its streaming business wears off, Smead said. \\\"The next 10 years are spectacularly in their favor in terms of demographics, but the expansion of the earnings ratio at the same time that COVID is crushing a significant part of their business doesn't make sense.\\\"\\n\\nChris Marangi, a portfolio manager of Gabelli Funds, said investors are likely waiting for a larger margin of safety before taking bigger positions in the company, given its high valuation. Its parks division will likely not return to more normalized levels of revenue until at least 2022, he said, giving the company a short-term hit to earnings but building up longer-term demand once a vaccine relieves Disney of instituting capacity caps.\\n\\nDisney has reopened its Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland parks, and on June 24 announced it was delaying a reopening of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California indefinitely. The company's Tokyo parks opened July 1.\\n\\n\\\"As we look out, Disney is the best-positioned media company for the next decade given their franchises and the success of Disney Plus in particular, but the near-term is going to be challenged,\\\" Marangi said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Reporting by David Randall; additional reporting by Helen Coster; editing by Megan Davies and Dan Grebler)\",\"13\":\"It appears that Tesla CEO Elon Musk is coming within striking distance of another major payout from his 10 year compensation plan. Provided that TSLA stock maintains its momentum, Musk may very well end up qualifying for the second tranche of his high risk, high reward pay package. And this time around, the payout could be worth $1.8 billion in options.\\n\\nUnder Elon Musk\\u2019s 10 year compensation plan, the CEO is set to receive 12 tranches of options provided that Tesla meets certain targets. These involve $50 billion increases in market capitalization and a series of operational goals. Musk\\u2019s compensation plan is notably high risk, as he will receive nothing if Tesla fails to reach its targets. For Musk to receive any of his performance awards, Tesla, and in turn, its investors, will have to experience significant milestones first.\\n\\nThe first of these milestones \\u2014 which required Tesla to have an average market cap of $100 billion over six months \\u2014 was secured this May. This tranche netted Elon Musk a payout of $700 million, which the CEO recently noted was more of a vesting of stock options. \\u201cNot actually a payout, just a vesting of stock options. It may never pay out, as the stock can\\u2019t be sold for 5 years after exercise. The stock must be bought & income taxes paid, then hold value for 5 years,\\u201d Musk wrote.\\n\\nIf Musk does end up qualifying for the second tranche of his 10 year compensation plan, he could get the option to purchase 1.69 million TSLA shares at $350.02 each. Considering that Tesla stock currently trades at almost $1,400 per share, and if Musk exercises those options and offloads the stock at its present day price, he could net as much as $1.8 billion in profit.\\n\\nTesla stock is currently on a tear, with the electric car maker\\u2019s shares surging about 500% over the last year as sales of the Model 3 remained strong and the company\\u2019s Model Y ramp in the United States began to hit its stride. Amidst these, Tesla\\u2019s operations in China are also seeing a massive ramp, thanks to the quick buildout of Gigafactory Shanghai, which was able to start producing locally made Model 3s for the Chinese market. Expansions in Berlin and in central United States are also expected, on top of a highly anticipated Battery Day event later this year.\\n\\nIf Elon Musk manages to hit all 12 tranches of his 10 year compensation plan, Tesla would have a market cap of $650 billion, making the electric car maker one of the most valuable companies in the world. This should net TSLA investors, especially those who have supported the company since its early days, a healthy profit, and it would give the CEO a nearly $60 billion payday. Musk currently takes no salary for his work at Tesla, with his compensation only coming from options.\\n\\nDisclosure: I have no ownership in shares of TSLA and have no plans to initiate any positions within 72 hours.\",\"14\":\"To hear President Donald Trump tell it, the coronavirus will soon disappear, jobs are coming back, and Congress needs to let a $600 weekly unemployment benefit expire July 31, which he calls a \\\"disincentive to work.\\u201d\\n\\nBut even with some jobs lost to the pandemic beginning to return, over 30 million people are still receiving the unemployment assistance and some fear the president's rosy assessment could leave them destitute if it goes away.\\n\\nDepending on the state they live in, recipients could lose well over half of their income overnight.\\n\\nKatherine Henry, a 37-year old Massachusetts resident who lost her job as a trainer for a professional rugby team due to the pandemic, told NBC News the weekly $600 payments have been a \\u201clifesaver\\u201d so far.\\n\\nBut with gyms and live sports among the industries hardest hit, and her wife\\u2019s food truck struggling to regain business, Henry\\u2019s been looking for other jobs but says the situation is bleak. She\\u2019s been writing and calling lawmakers asking them to renew the $600 benefit.\\n\\n\\u201cMy industry is just shuttered at this point,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI'd have no trouble working at our local Starbucks, but they aren't hiring. Republicans say it's an excuse not to go back to work, but there isn't any work.\\u201d\\n\\nThe benefit was included in the CARES Act passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in March when the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic became clear.\\n\\nBut it\\u2019s now become the subject of an intense partisan debate that is in some ways a proxy fight over how each side views the state of the recovery.\\n\\nTrump, pointing to a net gain of 2.5 million jobs in May and 4.8 million in June, has called the economy a \\u201crocket ship\\u201d and his advisers are touting a \\u201cV-shaped recovery\\u201d in which workers will be able to rapidly return to their jobs as the economy reopens.\\n\\n\\u201cToday's announcement proves that our economy is roaring back, it\\u2019s coming back extremely strong\\u201d Trump said after the June numbers came out.\\n\\nTo many Republicans, the $600 payments are simply too generous and will discourage recipients from quickly returning to the labor force.\\n\\nIn particular, critics complain that the $600 weekly benefit means many low-wage workers are making more than what they were before the pandemic. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that 5 out of 6 recipients would make more from unemployment than they could expect to earn from work if the payments were extended.\\n\\nLet our news meet your inbox.

The 45-year-old Delaware resident was furloughed from his job at a women\\u2019s formal wear company in March when the pandemic struck. But now, between state unemployment assistance and the $600 weekly federal aid, he\\u2019s earning $150 more per week than he did at his job.\\n\\n\\u201cI can see the argument that you\\u2019re just soaking it up, that you\\u2019re making more money from unemployment than from working. But trust me, I\\u2019d much rather be working than sitting around doing nothing,\\u201d Simpson said.\\n\\nDemocrats point to a worsening pandemic and dire long-term forecasts that suggest many Americans will be unable to safely go to work or find a new job and will require further aid to make rent and put food on their table.\\n\\n\\u201cIf we fail to renew the $600 per week increase in UI [unemployment insurance], millions of American families will have their legs cut out from underneath them at the worst possible time \\u2014 in the middle of a pandemic when unemployment is higher than it's been since the Great Depression,\\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said last week.\\n\\nGiven the persistence of the virus, economists are increasingly worried about a \\u201ccheckmark-shaped recovery.\\u201d In that scenario, the economy would see an initial wave of job growth as businesses reopen and adapt to the crisis, but millions would still be left out of work once the wave recedes. Recent gains still aren\\u2019t close to overtaking the more than 20 million jobs lost in April. Even last month's strong jobs report included 588,000 new layoffs that were permanent, rather than temporary furloughs.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve projects unemployment will remain over 9 percent at the end of the year, and that estimate came before the recent surge of cases in states like Arizona, Texas, Florida, and California that has prompted officials to pause or roll back reopening plans.\\n\\nFed Chairman Jay Powell and many economists have warned that a potential prolonged \\u201csecond wave\\u201d could dampen the recovery. The latest jobs report only covered the period up to the week of June 12, before the latest rise in cases, which prompted analysts like banking giant Goldman Sachs to lower their growth forecasts.\\n\\nWhile some businesses are reopening, others have closed or laid off workers, perhaps permanently. Since the jobs report, over 1.3 million people have submitted new applications for unemployment benefits every single week, still far above normal levels. Small businesses may also begin to exhaust federal loans and grants that were designed to keep workers on payroll, potentially setting off a new wave of layoffs.\\n\\nWorkers could face new headwinds in the fall as well. Many schools are unlikely to return full-time, cutting off a crucial source of child care that will make it difficult for parents to find and maintain a job.\\n\\n\\u201cWe know the economy is not going to return to full potential until the virus is gone. There are going to be jobs that people simply cannot do,\\u201d Martha Gimbel, manager of economic research at Schmidt Futures, said. \\u201cIf we screw this up, it\\u2019s about whether or not people will be able to feed their kids.\\\"\\n\\nTrump in recent days has demanded schools fully open, threatened to cut off funding to those that don\\u2019t, and criticized his own administration\\u2019s safety guidelines as too \\u201ctough\\u201d and \\u201cvery expensive.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Republicans and Democrats debate the best course ahead, neither side denies that enhanced unemployment benefits, along with other CARES Act provisions like business loans and stimulus payments, have had an enormous impact on Americans\\u2019 livelihoods so far. In many ways, they\\u2019ve shielded families from a Great Depression-level collapse.\\n\\nPersonal income actually rose 10.5 percent in April as much of the country was shut down to fight the pandemic, and Americans also managed to save 33 percent of their earnings, a rate far higher than normal.\\n\\nThe benefits were especially helpful to lower income Americans: One study by Columbia University researchers credited the CARES Act with keeping the poverty rate nearly the same as it was before the pandemic, even as tens of millions have been forced out of work.\\n\\nBut some businesses, which are required to bring back workers to fulfill the conditions of their own federal aid, have also complained that their employees are reluctant to return, given the benefits. Republicans see this as a sign benefits have overshot the mark.\\n\\n\\u201cRight now our policy is we\\u2019ll give you $600 a week only if you don\\u2019t work, but if you do work, you don\\u2019t get it,\\u201d Stephen Moore, a White House adviser, said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a stupid policy. Don\\u2019t pay people for not working.\\u201d\\n\\nInstead, Moore favors temporarily suspending payroll taxes, which would boost incomes for workers and business owners \\u2014 but not the unemployed.\\n\\nTrump has also talked up the idea of cutting payroll taxes, along with a variety of targeted breaks for different industries affected by the pandemic. Last week, he told Fox Business News that while he is open to a new round of stimulus payments as well, he wanted a \\u201cgreat incentive to work.\\u201d\\n\\nIn the Senate, McConnell has said lawmakers should continue \\u201cadequate\\u201d benefits for those who can\\u2019t work, but the $600 weekly payment was a \\u201cmistake\\u201d that encouraged people to remain unemployed. Some GOP lawmakers have suggested legislation that would pay bonuses to employees who return to work.\\n\\nAdding to the stress on the unemployed: Other provisions to protect them could be running out at the same time.\\n\\nMillions of renters are also protected from eviction under the CARES Act, but that measure is set to expire on July 25. A recent analysis by Urban Footprint warns that without some government assistance, upwards of 7 million renters are vulnerable to losing their home. Some similar measures at the state level are already expiring.\\n\\n\\u201cIt should be really clear this week that forcing people into homelessness is not in the public interest or our health interest,\\u201d said Shamus Roller, executive director of the National Housing Law Project.\",\"15\":\"Few parts of the stock market have been more exciting lately than the electric-vehicle (EV) industry, as established automakers and new upstarts fight to take advantage of rising demand for sustainable transportation. NIO (NYSE:NIO) is one rising player in the industry, as the Chinese company is aiming to sell its vehicles into the biggest market of consumers on earth.\\n\\nNIO's stock has risen fivefold just since early April, and shareholders have higher hopes than ever that the electric-vehicle company can do in China what Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has done in the U.S. market. However, with the share price rising so quickly, NIO needs to show investors some signs that its fundamental business prospects can keep up. In particular, the following three things would show NIO shareholders that the company has the endurance to be a long-term player in the EV industry.\\n\\n1. Vehicle delivery numbers need to rise markedly\\n\\nThe event that spurred the latest move higher in NIO shares was its release of second-quarter vehicle delivery volume figures. Investors were pleased to see an uptick in deliveries, especially given the pressures that the coronavirus pandemic had put on the economy. June deliveries amounted to more than 3,700 vehicles, up from just under 1,340 vehicles in June 2019. Overall, second-quarter deliveries of more than 10,300 compared quite favorably to 3,550 a year ago.\\n\\nYet this isn't the first time that NIO has sold between 3,000 and 4,000 vehicles in a month. In late 2018, NIO surpassed the 3,000 vehicle mark in both November and December. Monthly sales figures in the second half of 2019 were more consistent from month to month but still remained largely within a range of 2,000 to 3,000.\\n\\nContrast that with Tesla, which saw 50% growth in vehicle deliveries in 2019 and hopes to deliver 500,000 units this year. NIO has done well as a new company, but it needs to climb out of its recent range and really start building demand for its models.\\n\\n2. NIO needs to invest its capital well\\n\\nMany upstart companies fail because they don't have the capital to build out their businesses successfully. That's especially true in capital-intensive industries like manufacturing.\\n\\nNIO doesn't have that problem, though, because it's had consistent financial support from both private and public sources. On the private-sector side, Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEH.Y) has repeatedly invested in NIO, boosting its stake in the automaker to 15% just last month. The public sector joined in through an economic development fund that will promote the company's relocation to the Anhui province.\\n\\nInvestors are breathing a sigh of relief that NIO has liquidity at a time when many companies are starved for cash. But that's not enough to justify big share-price gains. NIO also has to use that money wisely, with expansion plans that can demonstrate the company's ability to follow a strong strategic vision.\\n\\n3. NIO needs new hit vehicles\\n\\nNIO's first electric vehicle was an eight-passenger SUV, dubbed the ES8, that drew an impressive audience. Yet when the automaker followed up with its ES6 six-passenger SUV, it essentially cannibalized its own past success, as ES8 sales sank to a near-standstill, even as ES6 sales took their place.\\n\\nNIO has plans to go in a slightly different direction with its next model. The EC6 will be a coupe model, although NIO is calling it a \\\"coupe SUV.\\\" It will offer long-range driving capabilities of more than 380 miles and provide acceleration from 0 to 60 mph of around 4.7 seconds.

He makes his team watch all the SpaceX failures, too, when the unmanned rockets explode. \\u201cFor the first many years, all the rockets crash and there's a lot of failure along the way, and then suddenly, they start working,\\u201d he says.\\n\\nGene editing, Evans believes, is on a similar trajectory, poised for a series of successful launches in the years ahead. \\u201cThe stuff we can do now in genome editing would have seemed like magic five or ten years ago,\\u201d he says, as technological advancements suddenly have biotechs competing to cure rare genetic diseases long out of reach.\\n\\nThe first generation of gene editing was Crispr, a technology developed in 2012 that can target and cut sections of DNA like a pair of scissors. Now Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Beam is pioneering Crispr 2.0. Its advancement, known as base editing, works more like a pencil, which can target a single misspelling in the DNA code allowing for much greater precision, says Evans, who is 43. Beam\\u2019s technology, which has yet to be tested in humans, could theoretically cure thousands of the genetic diseases caused by single letter misspellings, known as point mutations. Topping the company's targets is sickle cell disease\\u2014a point mutation that predominantly affects Black people and has been neglected through more than a century of racist attitudes.\\n\\nBeam, which was founded in 2017, went public in February and now has a market cap of $1.5 billion despite having no revenues and losing $95 million over the past year. What the company does have is 12 research programs for 10 different rare diseases, including beta thalassemia, another inherited blood disorder, and two types of blood cancer. None of the treatments have been cleared for clinical trials, but the company hopes to file a slew of applications in 2021.\\n\\nSickle cell disease is the most promising opportunity. It\\u2019s the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting about 100,000 people. The disease produces abnormal hemoglobin, the molecule that helps red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body. While normal red blood cells are shaped like doughnuts, sickle cells look like pointy crescent moons (thus the name), which clog up blood vessels and cut off oxygen supply to the bones and organs, causing \\u201cexcruciating pain,\\u201d explains Dr. Robert Liem, director of the comprehensive sickle cell program at the Lurie Children\\u2019s Hospital of Chicago.\\n\\nJohn Evans, CEO of Beam Therapeutics. ARCH VENTURE PARTNERS\\n\\nWith one out of every 365 Black babies born with sickle cell, the disease has an ugly racial history. By the mid-1900s, the presence of sickle-shaped cells in the blood viewed under a microscope were a \\u201cmarker for race,\\u201d says Shawn Bediako, professor of psychology at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, who focuses on stigma in healthcare. \\u201cWhen people who were not Black had sickle cell disease then the societal assumption was that then that person wasn't completely white,\\u201d even though the disease is found in people of many other ethnicities. In the 1960s, the Black Panther Party began to champion the right to health and implemented a national sickle cell screening program in the wake of government inaction.\\n\\nBut racist attitudes and a lack of federal funding still persist today. Sickle cell patients, who can end up in hospital emergency departments with serious pain, waited, on average, 25% longer than general patients and 50% longer than patients with bone fractures to be seen, according to a study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Sickle cell received an average of $812 in federal research funding per person over the last decade, while cystic fibrosis, a lung disease that predominantly affects white people, received more than $2,800 per person, even though sickle affects three times as many people, according to a paper in JAMA Network Open. \\u201cIf we really have to have this debate about whether or not Black life matters, I think we need look no further than sickle cell and how it's been treated as a medical condition to indicate that it really doesn't,\\u201d says Bediako.\\n\\nSickle cell was the first \\u201cmolecular disease\\u201d discovered, revealing how a change in one single amino acid could disrupt blood and oxygen supply to the entire body. The first drug to treat sickle cell, hydroxyurea, wasn\\u2019t approved until 1998, even though the disease has been known in the medical literature since 1910, with three more drugs coming to market since 2017. The only cure is a bone marrow transplant, which is limited to a small percentage of patients who have a matching sibling donor. But Beam is hoping to change that with its potentially curative base editing technology. \\u201cWe're going to go in and land our editor right on the mutation that causes sickle cell and change it to something that's normal,\\u201d Evans says.\\n\\nBase editing was pioneered in 2016 in the lab of David Liu, a core faculty member at the Broad Institute and a professor at Harvard University, along with postdoctoral fellows Alexis Komor, now an assistant professor at the University of California San Diego, and Nicole Gaudelli, the head of gene editing technologies at Beam. Liu cofounded Beam in 2017 along with Feng Zhang, a professor at the McGovern Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and core faculty member at the Broad Institute, and Dr. J. Keith Joung, endowed chair in pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. This is the second of three gene editing companies the scientific power trio has founded since 2013, along with Cambridge-based Editas Medicine, which is developing Crispr-based therapeutics, and Durham, North Carolina-based Pairwise Plants, which is using both Crispr and base editing to develop more nutritious crops. In 2019, Liu founded Prime Medicine, a third generation \\u201csearch and replace\\u201d genome editing technology, which he likens to a word processor.\\n\\n\\u201cI certainly, in my wildest dreams, never imagined this kind of precise capability to edit the genome,\\u201d says Dr. Francis Collins of the National Institutes of Health.\\n\\nLiu calls the human genome the \\u201cmost important gift your parents ever gave you.\\u201d It\\u2019s made up of 6 billion combinations of four letters known as bases: A, T, G, and C. A person with sickle cell disease has one base pair misspelling at a crucial location in their adult hemoglobin gene: a \\u2018T-A\\u2019 where there should be an \\u2018A-T\\u2019. That typo, which appears twice among the 6 billion letters, is the difference between normal hemoglobin and the abnormal hemoglobin that causes the rigid crescent-shaped cells.\\n\\nBeam is the first company to try to directly fix the base pair misspelling, though they can\\u2019t yet switch a T to an A. Instead, Beam switches the T to a C and the A to a G. While it appears odd to swap one typo for another, the new typo mimics a natural phenomenon, known as the Makassar variant, which results in functional red blood cells instead of the sickle shape.\\n\\nBeam is also trying another approach to curing the disease: Introducing a second mutation in a different location to override the production of sickle hemoglobin. It mimics a naturally occurring phenomenon in which a person has two sets of sickle hemoglobin genes, but doesn\\u2019t show signs of the disease. The reason? A different mutation in the fetal hemoglobin gene, which usually turns off in favor of adult hemoglobin as people age, but remains turned on and producing normal hemoglobin. \\u201cThey won the genetic lottery after losing it twice,\\u201d says Liu. Both programs showed promising results in mice.\\n\\nLiu, 47, prefers to focus on his academic and research pursuits, rather than commercialization of the technologies, as do his cofounders Zhang and Joung. The trio like to hire well-credentialed executives to run their companies, like Evans, who has a track record of successfully bringing precision medicines from the lab to the market.\\n\\nJohn Evans, CEO, Beam Therapeutics (L) and cofounders David Liu, J. Keith Joung, and Feng Zhang. DAN BUDWICK\\n\\nIn 2009, Evans, who earned an MBA from Wharton and a Masters in biotechnology from the University of Pennsylvania, was an early employee at Agios Pharmaceuticals, then a tiny biotech with a pre-clinical target related to cancer metabolism. The following year he helped broker a unique alliance between Cambridge-based Agios and big biopharma Celgene, ultimately leading to two FDA approvals for treatments for acute myeloid leukemia in the span of ten years, which sounds like a long time, but is much faster than the usual drug development timeline.\\n\\n\\u201cCelgene, gave us $130 million dollars upfront to explore this area of biology and Agios was able to preserve commercial right, and many other important features, so it was a very creative deal,\\u201d says David Schenkein, the former CEO of Agios and a general partner at Mountain View, California-based venture firm GV (formerly known as Google Ventures), which invested in Beam.\\n\\nAfter eight years at Agios, Evans left to become a venture partner at Arch Venture Partners, an early investor in Beam. In late 2016, he met Liu in his office in Cambridge to discuss the company, which was in stealth mode at the time. \\u201cI couldn't sleep that night, I was so excited about it,\\u201d Evans recalls.\\n\\nSince base editing is a platform, rather than a single drug, once the technology works in one disease, it will likely work in others. \\u201cThat ease of retargeting is going to mean that as we get it up and running, we can very quickly go through and treat a whole bunch of diseases and create a kind of sustainable flow of new medicines,\\u201d says Evans. He started in an interim CEO role at Beam and officially took the top job in January 2018.\\n\\nBeam can\\u2019t attack every disease so Evans has pursued strategic partnerships and licensing agreements with other gene editing companies, including Editas, Prime and another Cambridge-based biotech called Verve, which is using base editing to develop heart disease therapies. Joung is a Verve cofounder, and Evans serves on the boards of Prime and Verve. \\u201cIt's kind of a divide and conquer approach, where we're reducing redundancy and now I think more diseases, more patients are potentially going to benefit from the technology than otherwise,\\u201d Evans says.\\n\\nOf course, it\\u2019s impossible to predict whether Beam\\u2019s technological edge with base editing will ultimately prevail over earlier Crispr technologies that have the first-mover advantage, says David Nierengarten, a biotechnology analyst at Wedbush Securities. But what sets Beam apart so far based on their work in mice is \\u201cmore efficient\\u201d gene editing, meaning that \\u201chigher numbers of modified cells\\u201d will get into patients, says Nierengarten.\\n\\nSmall Targets\\n\\nBeam is researching a number of other rare diseases it hopes to treat, or even cure, with its precision gene editing technology. Here are the seven it has disclosed.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nSickle Cell Disease\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 100,000\\n\\nInherited blood disorder causes severe pain.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nBeta Thalassemia\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 1,000-2,000\\n\\nInherited blood disorder causes severe anemia.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nT-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 500-1,000 per year\\n\\nFast-growing blood cancer.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nAcute Myeloid Leukemia\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 20,000 per year\\n\\nFast-growing blood cancer.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 60,000\\n\\nInherited disorder causes lung and liver disease.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nGlycogen Storage Disoder 1a\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 1,400\\n\\nInherited disorder where body can\\u2019t store sugar.\\n\\n\\u2014\\n\\nStargardt Disease\\n\\nEstimated U.S. Patients: 5,500\\n\\nInherited eye disorder causes progressive vision loss.\\n\\nBeam has one key advantage: with its technology, the DNA double helix doesn\\u2019t need to be cut, like with first generation Crispr technologies. This means greater precision with less risk of random insertions and deletions of code.\\n\\nBeam\\u2019s true test will come next year, when the company plans to apply for authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials in humans. Even in these early stages, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, the $41.7 billion (2020 budget) federal research agency, says he\\u2019s \\u201creally excited\\u201d about the potential of base editing to take on the 7,000 rare diseases caused by DNA misspellings.\\n\\n\\u201cBy delivering this kind of base editor to the right tissue at the right time, you can imagine many of these [rare diseases] becoming treatable, maybe even curable,\\u201d says Collins, who is working with Liu on an NIH-funded research project using base editing (currently in mice) to correct the point mutation for progeria, a disease that causes children to rapidly age and die by the time they are teenagers. \\u201cI certainly, in my wildest dreams, never imagined this kind of precise capability to edit the genome, where you could go and find one letter out of 3 billion that needed to be fixed, and provide the apparatus to do that with relatively little risk of causing trouble elsewhere,\\u201d Collins says reflecting on his career and the rapid progress in gene editing over the past few years.\\n\\nBut one of the big technical challenges ahead for many diseases will be refining the delivery methods of successfully getting base editors into the patient\\u2019s body. While the sickle cell therapy can be done outside the body and inserted, for other diseases, like progeria, the base editor will have to be directly inserted into the patient, and there are several methods being developed. \\u201cYou have to come up with a delivery system that is going to take that base editing apparatus and efficiently and safely get it to the cells where it needs to do its magic,\\u201d says Collins. \\u201cAnd that's a big challenge.\\u201d\\n\\nThe other hurdle on the horizon will be affordability. Existing gene therapies tend to be outrageously expensive. Novartis, for instance, made headlines in 2019 for charging $2.1 million for Zolgensma, a breakthrough cure for spinal muscular atrophy. The majority of adult sickle cell patients don\\u2019t even have access to hydroxyurea, which is the cheapest generic treatment on the market. \\u201cWe just have a long way to go before we can realistically say that a substantial number of patients might benefit from these therapies,\\u201d says Dr. Liem, who chaired the American Society of Hematology clinical practice guidelines on sickle cell disease. While gene therapies are exciting, \\u201cthe vast majority of patients out there still need basic care,\\u201d says Liem.\\n\\nBut Evans hopes Beam can fundamentally change the rules of engagement. \\u201cWe're going to have profound impacts for patients\\u2019 lives in the very near future,\\u201d he says, since patients who participate in phase one could potentially leave the trial cured of sickle cell. \\u201cThat's the amazing thing about these one-time therapies.\\u201d\\n\\nThis post was updated at 11:30 am ET July 10 to incorporate two additional co-inventors of base editing.\",\"19\":\"LONDON\\u2014The worst effects of the coronavirus on global oil demand have passed but will continue to echo as the market slowly recovers in the second half of 2020, the International Energy Agency said Friday.\\n\\nIn its closely read monthly report, the IEA said global oil demand in the first half of 2020 plunged by 10.75 million barrels a day, down roughly 11% from last year.

The sale was partially as the result of a trailing stop loss being triggered, plus the open sale of additional shares at market prices. Dominion Energy was one of my top holdings with a 3x overweight position and bounced around in the top three in value, based on market movements. However, the sale of assets, coupled with a write-off of its Atlantic Coast Pipeline, altered its business profile for me. As the old saying goes, when facts change, it's time to review the justification for an investment.\\n\\n(Source: Seeking Alpha)\\n\\nIn my personal portfolio construction quirkiness, I have several views I use to evaluate my holdings. The first is my three \\u201cbuckets\\u201d: 1) cash, bonds, CDs, 2) equities bought primarily for capital gains, 3) equities bought primarily for income. This separation of assets allows me to analyze the overall initial reason for investing my personal capital. While there are some positions which offer a bit of both capital gains and above-average current income, most of each bucket\\u2019s positions were purchased with their respective overriding investment goal. Dominion Energy is in the income bucket and Berkshire Hathaway is in the capital gains bucket. In addition, my portfolio management style is to segregate positions by percentage of the total portfolio. With a \\u201cnibble in and nibble out\\u201d position approach, I target a \\u201cfull\\u201d position as 1.0% to 1.5% with a maximum of 4.5%, and those under 1.0% percent considered positions I am building or exiting over time. Dominion Energy was one of my top three holdings and was at a 3x full position weighting. Berkshire Hathaway is in the full position category.\\n\\nI built a position in Dominion Energy over the years. I have owned D for many years as one of the preferred southeast US utilities, mainly based on its favorable regulatory environment. I believed in the growing export of LNG but was looking for a \\u201csmaller\\u201d pure play, and chose Dominion Energy Midstream LP, whose main asset was the Cove Point LNG export terminal. Starting with its IPO in 2014, I built a nice position and added during its collapse to the low- to mid-teens in April and May 2018. Then came the buyback by the parent, which converted DM shares into D shares in January 2019. In addition, the South Carolina Gas and Electric fiasco offered a buying opportunity in SCG during the February to May 2018 time frame. SCG shares were also converted into D shares in January 2019. These three positions merged into an overweighted position at the beginning of 2019 and had been maintained until recently.\\n\\nI have advocated for an investment in Dominion Energy due to several important attributes. These included:\\n\\nThe company\\u2019s regulated utility footprint in geographic areas identified as having the best regulatory environment, as defined by Regulatory Research Associates, a division of S&P Global Market Intelligence. More on this topic can be found in my SA article titled \\\"Utilities: Regulatory Environment, COVID-19, And Taxes - Location Matters\\\". This is a critical aspect for all utility ownership, as these firms succeed largely based on their ability to earn an acceptable profit.\\n\\nDominion offers diversity of regulated gas and electric service, and about an even split in the number of customers it services. With the potential for gas utilities to outperform electric utilities over the long term, offering investors exposure to both improves D\\u2019s investor profile.\\n\\nCove Point LNG export facility offers additional diversity to a market that was growing, until it wasn\\u2019t. Approximately 90% of Cove Point\\u2019s production capacity is contacted under a long-term supply agreement. Utilizing 20-year contracts, Cove Point produces LNG for a joint venture of Sumitomo Corporation, one of the largest global energy trading firms, and GAIL (India) Ltd., the largest natural gas processing and distribution company in India. According to D's filing with the DOE, these contracts are tolling agreements, whereby buyers pay a fee to D to liquefy any gas they purchase and are considered take-or-pay agreements. While these are 20-year contracts, the initial terms are set for a period to expire in 2024.\\n\\nNatural gas infrastructure of FERC-regulated interstate pipelines and storage facilities offered the advantages of long-term profitability with little added capital expenditures for maintenance, and were wrapped into the corporate structure without investors' K-1s.\\n\\nWith the passage of the 2016 lower corporate tax rate, utilities regulated by state oversight needed to devise a method of returning the benefits of lower taxes to ratepayers. However, this was not the case for assets and businesses not under the jurisdiction of state PUCs, including Cove Point and various natural gas pipelines and storage facilities. Diversity of non-PUC regulated assets added to D's overall profitability due to lower federal income tax burdens.\\n\\nThen came the surprise announcement on July 5 of the sale of its gas infrastructure, the dividend cut, the multi-billion write-off of its ACP investment, and the realignment of its business model from ~70% to ~90% state PUC-regulated utility. Add this to the previous sale of a 50% interest in Cove Point and D\\u2019s business model has changed.\\n\\nIn addition, I am not a big fan of share buybacks unless the shares are actually retired and not just recycled to satisfy exercised executive compensation options. If shares are not retired, my opinion is the use of shareholder cash flow to buy back shares is a mere ruse to reward management. According to YCharts, while Dominion reduced its share count from 698 million shares outstanding to 580 million outstanding from 2006 to 2009, since then the share count has increased to 842 million outstanding. While there was a large jump in share count in 2019 from the purchase of DM and SCG, from 2016 to the end of 2018, D spent almost $7 billion to buy back shares but the share count still went up from 596 million to 680 million outstanding. In my more cynical old age, unless I see an actual share count decline, I do not consider share buybacks as an advantage to current shareholders. So, paint me as very skeptical that the current plan to buy back $3 billion in shares with the proceeds from the divestiture will be a benefit to shareholders. In addition, Value Line expects the share count to continue to climb from the current 842 million to 880 million outstanding in the 2023-2025 time period, albeit prior to this most recent announcement. Countering this, Credit Suisse expects share count to decline to 800 million outstanding and to remain at this level until 2023.\\n\\nBerkshire Hathaway has had a full position valuation in my portfolio for quite a while. I have been waiting for an event to give me a reason to add to my position. The purchase of Dominion\\u2019s natural gas infrastructure assets at an attractive price is a catalyst I needed to jump in with more capital. According to Credit Suisse, BRK.B paid 10.3x 2021 EBITDA, which is on the lower end of the pre-COVID-19 deal average of 12.0x for similar assets. As usual, BRK.B made a good long-term deal for its shareholders. This purchase will add to BRK.B\\u2019s growing utility and energy asset portfolio and will leapfrog the firm to a serious contender for one of the largest natural gas pipeline operators with an 18% market share. The balance of my Dominion sale proceeds will remain in my cash account, waiting for better overall equity valuations.\\n\\nPersonally, I rate Dominion Energy as Neutral, in line with the sell-side opinions as offered in the SA graphic below.\\n\\nThe lower dividend does not offer much advantage to shareholders compared to its peers. At the projected $2.50 dividend, the current price equates to a ~3.4% yield, in line with other electric and multi-line utilities but below selected utilities identified in favorable regulatory states, such as Southern Company (SO) and Emera (OTCPK:EMRAF). Even at the projected 6% annual dividend increase, it will take 7 years to regain the dollar dividend of pre-announcement.\\n\\nWhile maintaining a full position in D and having realized a portion of my capital gains, I recommend current Dominion shareholders to retain a portion of their position as an average-valued income investment.\\n\\nAuthor's note: Please refer to my profile page for disclosures.\\n\\nDisclosure: I am\\/we are long BRK.B, D, EMRAF, SO.

USA TODAY\\n\\nFor a young Black woman trying to make her way near the turn of the last century, job options were few. In most cases, she worked for a white family, caring for their children, cleaning their house or doing their laundry.\\n\\nBut in 1911, when Lillian Richard left her hometown of Hawkins, Texas to seek domestic work in Dallas, she found a different opportunity \\u2013 offering cooking demonstrations and becoming one of the original faces of the Aunt Jemima pancake brand. Despite the kerchiefed caricature on the packaging, being a brand ambassador allowed Richard to travel as well as make a living, and brought her renown in her community.\\n\\n\\\"I want people to know she was a real person,'' says her great-niece Vera Harris. \\\"She wasn\\u2019t just some cartoon character. She ... had feelings like we all have and just wanted to make a living at the age of 20. She was happy and proud of the work she did.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\nAunt Jemima. Uncle Ben's. Cream of Wheat. Mrs. Butterworth. The images associated with those iconic brands not only sold syrup, rice and cereal but perpetuated painful stereotypes that negatively shaped how African Americans and women were perceived for generations.\\n\\nNow, amid a national reckoning on racism in the wake of the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans killed by police, the makers of those products are changing or reviewing their controversial branding.\\n\\n\\\"It is symbolic, but ... symbols have real power,'' said Gregory Smithers, a history professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who co-authored the book \\\"Racism in American Popular Media: From Aunt Jemima to the Frito Bandito.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Symbols give shape and texture to our everyday reality,'' he continued. \\\"They inform how we see other people, other cultures. They inform how we vote, how politicians make priorities and pass laws. And they inform what we see as acceptable forms of representation.''\\n\\nBut behind some of those symbols or images, however distorted, were real men and women with families, ambitions and lives.\\n\\nTwo men named Frank\\n\\nFrank Brown was the man whose image became the face of Uncle Ben\\u2019s in 1946, says Caroline Sherman, a spokeswoman for Mars Food, the brand's parent company.\\n\\nBrown was a maitre d' in a Chicago restaurant. Not much else is known about him, but Sherman says there is an effort underway to learn more.\\n\\n\\\"I don\\u2019t have a lot of details about his past,'' she says, \\\"but that\\u2019s what we're hoping to gather as we go forward.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\nLillian Richard (seated, right corner) was one of the first women to portray Aunt Jemima, according to her family. (Photo: Vera Harris)\\n\\nThe name Uncle Ben apparently came from an African American farmer in Texas who was renowned for his high-quality rice. According to the brand's website, Gordon Harwell and his partner who co-founded the grains line decided to change the name of what was previously called Converted Brand Rice in the late 1940s to draw in new customers. They came up with the new name while having dinner at a favorite Chicago restaurant.\\n\\nThe brand attempted a makeover in 2007 when \\\"Ben'' became a successful, modern businessman instead of a servant. But in the current moment, Mars has decided that shift didn't go far enough and says it plans to change the image on the packaging, though it doesn't know when or what those changes will be.\\n\\nLearning more about Brown will help inform the process, Sherman says. \\\"Getting more and more information and perspective about the past is only going to help that process be stronger,\\\" she says.\\n\\nLillian Richard portrayed Aunt Jemima in cooking demonstrations at fairs, stores and other public events. (Photo: Vera Harris)\\n\\nA bit more is known about Frank L. White, a chef who is believed to be the model for the image used on boxes of Cream of Wheat.\\n\\nWhite was born on the island of Barbados around 1867, then moved to the U.S. seven years later and got his citizenship in 1890, according to a June 2007 story by the Associated Press, which cited a Lansing State Journal interview with researcher Jesse Lasorda.\\n\\nCream of Wheat debuted in 1893 and initially featured a fictional character dubbed \\\"Rastus,'' a racist term for Black men depicted as simple-minded and irresponsible that arose during the minstrel era. But around the turn of the last century, White's picture was taken while he worked at a restaurant in Chicago, according to the AP.\\n\\nThe man whose likeness became the new face of the cereal brand wasn't identified at the time. But White claimed it was him, and the story became part of local lore in Leslie, Michigan, the town where White lived for roughly two decades before his death on Feb. 15, 1938, according to a report in the Jackson Citizen Patriot cited by AP.\\n\\n\\\"We understand there are concerns regarding the chef image, and we are committed to evaluating our packaging and will proactively take steps to ensure that we and our brands do not inadvertently contribute to systemic racism,\\u201d B&G Foods said in a news release about reviewing the brand image. \\u201cB&G Foods unequivocally stands against prejudice and injustice of any kind.\\u201d\\n\\nIn 2007, White's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery got a new granite marker. It included an etching of the chef portrayed on the Cream of Wheat Box.\\n\\n\\\"Everybody deserves a headstone,\\\" Lasorda, who led the effort for the new marker, told the Lansing State Journal.\\n\\nThe meaning of 'Mammy'\\n\\nConagra Brands, the maker of Mrs. Butterworth's, has said that the syrup bottles shaped like a matronly woman were \\\"intended to evoke the images of a loving grandmother.''\\n\\nBut last month, Conagra became one of several companies to say it would start \\\"a complete brand and packaging review ... We stand in solidarity with our Black and Brown communities and we can see that our packaging may be interpreted in a way that is wholly inconsistent with our values.''\\n\\nMrs. Butterworth is not believed to be modeled after a real person, but to some she conveys a disturbing stereotype of a servile Black woman who is content to spend her life waiting on whites.\\n\\n\\\"That\\u2019s a clear appropriation of the \\u201c'mammy\\u201d motif,'' says Smithers, explaining how that caricature was \\\"loyal, subservient, and always ready with some down-home wisdom ... That imagery became so ingrained in the way Americans saw race in the 20th century that it fit almost unnoticed into a panoply of similarly offensive marketing campaigns.''\\n\\nOne of the most controversial of those campaigns was that of Aunt Jemima.\\n\\nThe brand was born in 1889 when owners Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood created the pancake mix. The original image on the packaging was inspired by Nancy Green, \\\"a storyteller, cook and missionary worker,'' according to the brand's website.\\n\\nGreen was born into slavery in Kentucky and worked as a cook and housekeeper for a judge on the south side of Chicago, says Smithers. She first performed as Aunt Jemima at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893 and went on to play the character in print and on radio for many more years.\\n\\nSmithers says it doesn't appear that Green received royalties for the use of her likeness. Her income mostly came from her job as a housekeeper and the small fee she was paid for her advertising appearances.\\n\\n\\\"One myth that needs quashing is the idea that Green died a millionaire,'' he says. \\\"It's simply not true.\\\" She was, however, \\\"able to live (a) comfortable life and donate money to her church.''\\n\\nGreen was the first of a rotating cast of women -- at least four, perhaps a dozen -- whose likenesses were referenced on Aunt Jemima packaging, or who played the character at cooking demonstrations and in print, radio and TV ads.\\n\\n\\\"The imagery naturalized the idea that African American women existed merely to serve white people,'' Smithers says. \\\"That subservient imagery proved harmful on a number of levels. It informed popular assumptions about Black womanhood. It shaped the way people interacted with Black women, (including) exposing them to sexual violence, and informed the racism that punctuated not only pop culture, but Twentieth-Century feminist movements, politics, and social history.\\\"\\n\\nBut some descendants of the women who played Aunt Jemima say their stories are more complicated.\\n\\n'Acknowledge these women'\\n\\nRichard's family believes she was the third woman to portray Aunt Jemima. Born in 1891, the fifth of eleven children, Richard eventually left her hometown to try to earn a better living.\\n\\n\\\"You can\\u2019t think about 2020,'' says Harris, her great-niece. \\\"You have to go back and try to imagine how it was in 1911 ... If you were a woman, you did domestic work. You were cooks, you were maids. You took care of white people's children. So she went out for better opportunities because Dallas was much larger than Hawkins, Texas. She knew if she went there she could find domestic work and it would pay more.\\u2019\\u2019\\n\\nInstead, Richard began promoting Aunt Jemima products, putting on demonstrations at stores, fairs, and other events. It was a job she would do for the next 23 years.\\n\\n\\\"They\\u2019d bring her back in a fancy car,'' Harris says of her great aunt's employer. \\\"Her brothers and sisters and friends would be all excited to see her when she came home because she had stories to tell them about what she saw in the places she went to. She kind of became a little celebrity.''\\n\\nRichard never had children, but was married twice, first around 1912 to a man named Golden Leflore who died roughly two years later of tuberculosis. She later married James Diggs in 1935, but he also died, says Harris.\\n\\nRichard retired after suffering a stroke and returned home to Hawkins where she was cared for by relatives. She died in 1956.\\n\\nHarris says her family remains proud of Richard's legacy, hosting a pancake breakfast for the Hawkins community every March where a relative, dressed as Richard portraying Aunt Jemima, takes to the stage to talk about Richard's life.\\n\\nAnd Harris says the city erected a historical marker to Richard in 1995, in the neighborhood where she grew up. There is also a sign that proclaims Hawkins is the pancake capital of Texas and the former home of Richard who it notes portrayed Aunt Jemima.\\n\\n\\\"Not only is our family proud of her,'' Harris says, \\\"but the community as a whole.''\\n\\nHarris says she is fully supportive of the Black Lives Matter movement that is calling for racial equity and justice. She also understands Quaker Oats' decision to change the name and imaging of its Aunt Jemima brand, which the company \\u2014 now a part of PepsiCo \\u2014 said in a statement is \\\"based on a racial stereotype,'' despite a revamp in 1989 where the character stopped wearing a red bandanna and donned pearl earrings instead.\\n\\nBut \\\"we don\\u2019t want her history to be wiped away,'' Harris said of Richard. \\\"My aunt was a smart lady.''\\n\\nCLOSE Aunt Jemima brand plans to remove the logo and change its name in the wake of renewed calls for racial equality. USA TODAY\\n\\nHarris has contacted Quaker Oats and says she would like the company, which bought the Aunt Jemima brand in 1926, to consider creating a commemorative box that lists all the women who played the character on the back.\\n\\nThat might include Anna Robinson, who according to the brand's website took on the role at the second Chicago World\\u2019s Fair in 1933 and then toured the nation, earning enough income \\u201cto provide for her children and buy a 22-room house\\\" where she rented out rooms.\\n\\nAsked if it planned such a commemoration, Quaker said in an emailed statement that it didn't have anything to add beyond its previous announcement that it would be changing Aunt Jemima's branding. \\\"We\\u2019re in the process of working on the packaging redesign, but no final decisions have yet been made.\\\"\\n\\nBut Harris says the box could perhaps display photos of the women as they looked when they weren't dressed in costume.\\n\\n\\\"Say something like 'We wouldn\\u2019t be where we are without the blood, sweat and tears of these Aunt Jemimas','' she says. There could also be a short explanation about why the image is no longer used. \\\"But let the world know these were vital, live people. They weren\\u2019t minstrel, made-up characters. ...

He declined to provide further details.\\n\\nReuters reported earlier Thursday that Coinbase was seeking legal teams in advance of filing for a public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ahead of a direct listing. In a direct listing, shareholders in the private market are able to sell their holdings though the company itself does not issue new shares or raise additional money.\\n\\nAn investor day can often be a harbinger of a planned direct listing, as Jamie McGurk, a former operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), wrote on the venture capital firm\\u2019s blog lost year.\\n\\n\\u201cThe company will invite investors to their Investor Day, where they will publicly talk about the company and financial results \\u2013 though still only about historical performance,\\u201d wrote McGurk (now a managing partner with Coatue Management), noting that this takes place about five weeks prior to the first trading day.\\n\\nA16z, it should be noted, is one of Coinbase\\u2019s investors, including leading its $25 million Series B round in December 2013.\\n\\nDecentralization and direct listings\\n\\nDirect listings allow existing shareholders, such as venture capitalists, to trade their equity in a public market without the company itself selling any new shares.

The cuts were supposed to take ~10% off the markets with July's cut clocking in at 9.6 million bpd.\\n\\nBut now there are signs that the pendulum could have swung a bit too far, with the markets beginning to experience shortages of key crude grades.\\n\\nThere are growing signs that the markets are undersupplied with Urals and Arab Light thanks to continuing deep production cuts as well as a rebound in demand by key customers such as China and Northern Asia.\\n\\nThe price of Urals, Russia's flagship grade, has flipped to record premiums to the Brent crude benchmark, briefly changing hands at $2.40 a barrel above Dated Brent last week to reflect the undersupply.\\n\\nThat marks a sharp turnaround compared to a discount of more than $4.50 a barrel recorded in April. Urals for delivery to Rotterdam, the main oil refinery hub in northwest Europe, were selling at a premium of $1.90 by the end of June, matching a prior record high. This, in effect, means that Rotterdam Urals were selling at ~$45 a barrel, a far cry from the $15 a barrel they commanded in early April.\\n\\nOil markets in backwardation\\n\\nA similar pattern is being observed for other sour crude grades, which are commanding premium prices even with global oil demand still 10% below normal levels.\\n\\nUnder ordinary circumstances, medium-sour crude that Saudi Arabia and its OPEC partners pump is usually cheaper than light sweet crude with a lower sulfur content. However, OPEC, which mostly pumps medium-sour crude, has dramatically cut output to its lowest level since 1991. Further, Iran and Venezuela, which also supply medium and heavy sour crude, have both seen production severely curtailed due to U.S. sanctions as well as a lack of investment.\\n\\nConsequently, Saudi Aramco has been able to raise the price of the crude it sells to refiners for three months in a row. And now for the first time ever, Aramco is selling its most dense crude, known as Arab Heavy, at the same price as its flagship Arab Light, a clear indication of strong demand for medium-heavy sour grades. Under normal circumstances, Arab Heavy sells at a discount of $2-to-$6\\/barrel to Arab Light. Related: Big Oil\\u2019s Investment Risk Is Spiking\\n\\nTo make matters even more interesting, medium-heavy sour crude for immediate delivery is commanding premiums to forward contracts, a situation known as backwardation. That's a 180-degree turn from the situation just two and a half months ago when oil markets were in deep contango, meaning forward contracts were selling at a big premium to near-term contracts.\\n\\nProduction cuts working\\n\\nCME data shows that oil futures in general are beginning to flirt with backwardation-- a positive sign for oil markets. Back in May, the markets were in super-contango with futures for June delivery trading at just half the value of January 2021 futures; the situation is far less dramatic with futures for August delivery trading at $40.90\\/barrel compared with $41.54 for January 2021 futures.\\n\\nThese data sets are encouraging signs that OPEC+ members could largely be sticking to their pledges. Last month, Saudi Arabia and Russia warned members of the cartel that there was no room for noncompliance whatsoever after May compliance clocked in at just 74% of agreed cuts. Notably, Iraq cut just 38% of its promised cuts while Nigeria fared even worse, cutting a mere 19% of its commitments. That said, the importance of dramatic cuts by U.S. producers cannot also be overstated. In May, Reuters reported that North American producers were on course to cut 1.7 million barrels per day by the end of June with the U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette estimating that U.S. production would drop by 2 to 3 million bpd by the end of the year.\\n\\nBut more importantly, the latest oil price trends are confirmation that, indeed, the production cuts are working as intended by helping to rebalance the markets.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused global oil demand to fall off a cliff, with U.S. consumption falling to levels last seen nearly four decades ago. With global oil production at record highs, supply quickly overwhelmed demand leading to an acute storage crunch that triggered the historic oil price crash into negative territory.\\n\\nSource: Quartz\\n\\nOil prices have recovered ever since but remain a long way off the $60\\/bbl level they were trading at last December. The current oil price of ~$40\\/bbl could be around the breakeven that Russia needs to balance its books but far from satisfactory for Saudi Arabia, which needs ~80\\/bbl or majority of U.S. shale producers who need $50-$55 per barrel to break even.\\n\\nWith the current level of cuts set to lapse at the end of July, it's going to be interesting to see whether \\\"OPEC+ is until death do us part,\\\" as Prince Abdulaziz famously quipped a month ago.\\n\\nBy Alex Kimani for Oilprice.com\\n\\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\",\"39\":\"CLOSE The number of Americans getting on airplanes has sunk to a level not seen in more than 60 years as people shelter in their homes to avoid catching or spreading the new coronavirus.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is at 3.03%, the lowest in Freddie\\u2019s survey history dating back to 1971.\\n\\nAnd, rates are headed even lower. The 15-year fixed-rate is bound to be under 2% by year\\u2019s end. The 30-year fixed will be under 2% sometime next year.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s look at the trendlines.\\n\\nMortgage rates tend to follow the 10-year Treasury rates. These days mortgage rates are running much higher than they\\u2019ve been averaging.\\n\\nConsider this math. I tracked the average 10-year Treasury rate from the middle of each June (not the average of the month) from 2010 to 2020. The 10-year Treasury rate averaged 2.24%.\\n\\nSeparately, I took the Freddie Mac\\u2019s 30-year fixed rate from its true monthly average data set for each June, from 2010 through 2020. Freddie Mac\\u2019s 30-year fixed averaged 4.013% over that same June timeline, meaning its mortgage rates have been running about 1.773% higher than the 10-year Treasury rates.\\n\\nFast forward to now. This week we find the 10-year Treasury rate is 0.67% and Freddie\\u2019s 30-year is 3.03%. That means mortgage rates are an average 2.36% higher than the 10-year Treasury. If we apply the 1.773% average mortgage rate calculated from the June 2010 to June 2020 data set, rates should be averaging 2.443%. That is a far cry (more than \\u00bd point higher in rate) from today\\u2019s Freddie rate of 3.03%.\\n\\nAt the same time, America is shutting down again with the resurgence of COVID-19. How much wherewithal will companies and individuals have to absorb the financial and emotional toll of stop-start-stop?\\n\\nWith such low interest rates, the mortgage industry is charging more points and fees to boost profits as seen in the Mortgage Bankers Association report June 12, which shows quarterly production revenues were up roughly 10%.\\n\\nMortgage application lines are long. The process can be particularly condescending and humiliating (proving your job and\\/or your company income is ongoing amid the COVID-19 backdrop). If your loan is getting funded in 30 days or less, consider yourself lucky. In some cases, it\\u2019s taking three or four months, according to some of my industry colleagues.\\n\\nAs those lines thin out and competition becomes a larger issue again, lenders will sharpen their pencils. They will offer more aggressive pricing and fewer points, in part by reducing their profit margins. We\\u2019ll eventually get back to the 10-year Treasury rate plus 1.773% for 30-year mortgage shoppers.\\n\\n\\u201cRates will grind lower,\\u201d said Seth Sprague, principal at Stratmor Group. \\u201cLoans will get harder to do as the economy isn\\u2019t opening up.\\u201d He thinks increasing capacity \\u2014 recruiting and training new employees and technology \\u2014 will help close more loans.\\n\\n\\u201cExpectations are that rates will go down over the next year,\\u201d said Guy Cecala, editor and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance. \\u201cThere is 100 basis points of extra margin built into the system now.\\u201d (Here\\u2019s an example: 100 basis points on a $400,000 loan is 1% or $4,000.)\\n\\nI\\u2019m already receiving at least one daily California lender rate sheet offering 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 2.25%. California mortgage rates tend to run lower than Freddie Mac\\u2019s national survey average rates due to larger average loan sizes, albeit with too many points to pull the trigger.\\n\\nRegardless, we continue to fund the 30-year fixed loans in the 2.75% range with low points and fees. And, 15-year mortgages are funding at 2.25% with low points and fees.\\n\\nNot everybody agrees.\\n\\nDr. Raymond Sfeir, director, Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University, expects the 10-year Treasury rate to go higher by the end of the year barring another COVID-19 wave. \\u201cI expect an economic recovery in the 3rd and 4th quarters of this year assuming we don\\u2019t have a second wave in the fall.\\u201d\\n\\nFreddie Mac rate news\\n\\nRelated Articles Bidding war strategies: How to set yourself above the competition\\n\\nAvoid a re-trade by getting ahead of buyer requests\\n\\nOrange County home price forecast to drop 5.2%, 1st decline in 8 years\\n\\nWant 5 buildings, 23 rental units in Laguna Beach?

At the same time, it found negligible evidence that dangerous metals and minerals are added to these products.\\n\\nReform advocates have emphasized the need for FDA to develop regulations to ensure quality control in the market.

The legislation stipulated that FDA had 180 days to \\u201cperform a sampling study of the current CBD marketplace to determine the extent to which products are mislabeled or adulterated.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cTogether, this information will provide the Agency with a better understanding of product characteristics in the current CBD marketplace and will help protect and promote public health,\\u201d the report said.\\n\\nFDA described the three phases of CBD testing it has overseen since 2014.\\n\\nDuring the first period, from 2014 to 2018, it looked at a sample of 78 cannabis products marketed to humans and pets. They found that 67 of them (86 percent) contained CBD. Of the 23 products FDA analyzed in 2014, only eight (35 percent) had CBD concentrations that were consistent with their labeling.\\n\\nIn 2019, the agency tested 34 additional CBD products for a wide range of potentially dangerous materials such as arsenic and lead. They determined that the \\u201clevels found in these 34 products did not raise significant public health concerns.\\u201d\\n\\nAmong 31 products that were tested for cannabinoids, 21 had labels that specified a CBD concentration. Only seven of them (33 percent) ultimately contained CBD within 20 percent of what was noted on the label.\\n\\nFor 2020, the agency said, \\u201cGiven the extensive data gaps regarding the current CBD marketplace, the results from previous product testing, and in response to the congressional directive\\u2026FDA is undertaking a more extensive CBD product sampling effort.\\u201d\\n\\nThat effort involved a short-term plan to 147 products for cannabinoids, 138 of which contained CBD.\\n\\n\\u201cOf the 102 products that indicated a specific amount of CBD, 18 products (18 percent) contained less than 80 percent of the amount of CBD indicated, 46 products (45 percent) contained CBD within 20 percent of the amount indicated, and 38 products (37 percent) contained more than 120 percent of the amount of CBD indicated,\\u201d the report states. Only one of 133 samples had potentially hazardous materials, however.\\n\\nLooking ahead, the agency has long-term testing plans that will involve using \\u201ca sampling methodology to create a representative, random sample of the current CBD product marketplace.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cThe Agency is purchasing data on brands, product categories, and distribution channels for CBD products,\\u201d it said. \\u201cFDA is also in the process of developing its own comprehensive list of brands operating in the CBD market space by assembling data from targeted internet searches and analytics. FDA intends to leverage both data sets to randomly sample products across brands, product categories, and distribution channels, while favoring products with a higher market share.\\u201d\\n\\nThe sampling is expected to cover cannabis tinctures, oils, extracts, capsules, powders, waters and other beverages, food items, cosmetics, personal lubricants, tampons, vape cartridges and products sold for pets.\\n\\nInterestingly, FDA also revealed in the report that it is working with the nation\\u2019s only federally authorized marijuana cultivation facility at the University of Mississippi to develop techniques to test for hemp and its derivatives in cosmetics.\\n\\nThe advocacy group U.S. Hemp Roundtable said in an email blast that \\u201cthere\\u2019s not much news\\u201d in FDA\\u2019s report.\\n\\n\\u201cCiting previous testing data and some more recent but limited random sampling, the FDA revealed what we already knew: While more work needs to be done to ensure CBD products consistently meet label claims, the majority of products do not contain unsafe contaminant levels, specifically heavy metals,\\u201d it said. \\u201cAs an industry that holds itself to the highest standards, we would like to rid the marketplace of all improperly labeled products and unsafe products.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s high time for the FDA to regulate CBD as a dietary supplement and food additive,\\u201d the industry group said. \\u201cThe agency\\u2019s current public stance not only impairs hemp farmers and small businesses; an unregulated marketplace poses real health and safety concerns.\\u201d\\n\\nThe Consumer Brands Association (CBA), for its part, said that the FDA data \\u201cfurther affirms the need for federal regulatory clarity.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u201cAllowing bad actors to continue to put products on the market, unchecked, is a threat to consumer safety everywhere,\\u201d Betsy Booren, CBA\\u2019s senior vice president for regulatory and technical affairs, said.\\n\\nToday's findings are even more reason Congress must provide funding and resources to @US_FDA so it can create the regulatory framework consumers of #CBD products deserve. https:\\/\\/t.co\\/v6T1l8LeDQ pic.twitter.com\\/6gn4HlFWNO \\u2014 Consumer Brands (@consumerbrands) July 8, 2020\\n\\nAs FDA continues to conducts these tests and develop regulations for CBD to be marketed as food items or dietary supplements, it continues to issue warnings to cannabis businesses in certain cases\\u2014such as instances in which companies claimed CBD could treat or cure coronavirus\\u2014and provide public notices about recalls.

The company has kicked off recruiting efforts and intends to hire 100 employees by the end of the year.\\n\\n``Google is a titan in the global economy and we are honored to have their first-class operation in our city,'' said Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite.\\n\\nGoogle's other operations centers are located in India and the Philippines.\\n\\n``This is a true testament to our skilled workforce and the increasing economic strength of our great state,`` Gov. Tate Reeves said. ``Mississippi and the Southaven community welcome Google with open arms, and we look forward to growing this partnership and creating opportunities for success for years to come.''\\n\\nConstruction on the Southaven site is set to begin in the coming months.\\n\\n\",\"56\":\"At least 10 groups with a history of making anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ or anti-immigrant statements received loans from the government's small business coronavirus relief fund.\\n\\nThe Center for Immigration Studies, for instance, a Washington, D.C.-based organization described as a \\\"hate group\\\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center, got as much as $1 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, with the loan made by United Bank. The Southern Poverty Law Center in 2017 documented more than 2,000 instances in which the Center for Immigration Studies \\\"circulated the writings of white nationalists and antisemitic writers.\\\"\\n\\nThe 10 policy groups received a total of as much as $10 million in assistance from the Paycheck Protection Program. Eight of those groups are identified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.\\n\\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\\n\\nAnother group is headed by James Dobson, whom Southern Poverty Law Center has said \\\"is well known for his anti-LGBT views,\\\" claiming that homosexuals will \\\"destroy the earth.\\\"\\n\\nA tenth group, Concerned Women for America, has called allowing same-sex couples to raise children unconstitutional, according to pro-LGBTQ rights organization Human Rights Campaign.\\n\\nThe publicly subsidized funding of what are often described as hate groups underscores the criticism that the hastily enacted Paycheck Protection Program lacked safeguards to ensure an equitable distribution of funds, especially to what many people would view as traditional for-profit small businesses. Among those who struggled to gain access to PPP loans are black and Hispanic business owners, with a survey finding that only 12% of such applicants received the forgivable low-interest loans, according to a survey from racial equality groups Color of Change and UnidosUS.\\n\\n\\\"The Trump administration designed a program that largely excludes minority owned small businesses but left the door open to taxpayer funds propping up hate groups,\\\" said Kyle Herrig, the president of Accountable.US, a group that advocates against government corruption and waste. \\\"That's indefensible.\\\"\\n\\nThe Paycheck Protection Program, run by the U.S. Small Business Administration, was passed by Congress to help all kinds of small employers survive the crushing impact of the coronavirus pandemic, providing $660 billion in loans that charge just 1% interest. Nonprofits, as long as they have fewer than 500 employees, were allowed to apply for the loans as well, just as for-profits with fewer than 500 employees could. The government loans are completely forgivable, including interest, if the majority of the funds is directed toward paying employees.\\n\\nThe SBA earlier this week released a list of some 650,000 companies and organizations that each received more than $150,000 from the program, including churches, Girl Scout chapters and nonprofits pushing liberal as well as conservative causes. While the SBA did not disclose the exact loan amounts, it provided a range of funding that each organization received.\\n\\nPPP is \\\"a bad idea\\\"\\n\\nMark Krikorian, who is the Center for Immigration Studies' executive director, told CBS MoneyWatch that he is against government handouts. \\\"As a citizen I think the Paycheck Protection Program is a bad idea,\\\" Krikorian said. \\\"But as the head of an organization, I had a responsibility to my board and employees to take advantage of the loan.\\\"\\n\\nKrikorian said his organization will likely apply to have the loan forgiven.\\n\\nA fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies on July 6 wrote that the recent spike in coronavirus cases in Texas was the result of an \\\"ongoing influx of seriously ill\\\" immigrants from \\\"Covid-exploding Mexico.\\\" However, officials have said that the spread of coronavirus from Mexico is mostly linked to American citizens returning for treatment. Mexico officially reported 6,300 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, compared to more than 54,000 in the U.S. that day.\\n\\nA report from the Center for Media and Democracy, a corruption watchdog, on Tuesday identified six of the nonprofits that have been labeled hate groups. Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Arizona branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Center for Media and Democracy that many of the groups that \\\"traffic in hate\\\" are well funded by private supporters.\\n\\n\\\"This just highlights more cases of vital funding getting into the hands of those who didn't need it, while many small businesses in our communities came up empty and are having to fold,\\\" Siddiqi said.\\n\\nThe SBA's list also includes a number of pro-immigration groups, including the National Immigration Forum, which got as much as $1 million from the PPP in a loan through Bank of America. Also on the list was the Freedom for All Americans Fund, which, according to its website, seeks to \\\"secure full nondiscrimination protections for LGBTQ people nationwide.\\\"\\n\\nWhat some of the groups are saying these days\\n\\nThe SBA barred a number of companies from getting Paycheck program loans, including strip club operators, sellers of legal marijuana and firms that directly lobby the federal government and politicians. But while lobbyists were banned, advocacy groups weren't, which opened the door to all types of issue-focused groups receiving money.\\n\\nAnd while the SBA has set up the rules of the program, it's generally up to individual banks to decide who is eligible for the loans. The SBA has said that it may audit some of the loans, including those over $2 million, if borrowers apply for forgiveness.\\n\\nA variety of banks made the loans identified by CBS MoneyWatch. Regions Bank, one of the largest banks in the country, lent as much as $2 million to the American Family Association, designated as an anti-LGBTQ hate group by the SPLC, through the Paycheck program.\\n\\nA recent post on the American Family Association's website called Black Lives Matter an \\\"infernal and life-threatening organization\\\" that was dedicated to the \\\"destruction of the nuclear family.\\\" It also said BLM was a serpent \\\"envenoming America and defiling its cities,\\\" and worse than \\\"heinous terror outfit ISIS.\\\"\\n\\nRegions declined to comment. American Family Association did not return a request for comment.\\n\\nAlso on the list of PPP recipients is the Federation for American Immigration Reform. FAIR and its sister organization the Immigration Reform Law Institute received two government-backed loans for as much as $1.35 million. Both loans were made by TD Bank.\\n\\nThe SPLC calls FAIR an anti-immigrant hate group with \\\"ties to white supremacist groups.\\\" Recently, FAIR has defended the deployment of officers from the Immigration and Custom Enforcement to police protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd while in custody of Minneapolis police. It likened the Black Lives Matter protests to \\\"violent anarcho-revolutionary upheavals\\\" and said that \\\"that some of the arrested rioters included illegal aliens.\\\"\\n\\nFAIR, through a spokesperson, declined to comment for this article.

But in a rare move, the company surprised shoppers with its first warehouse sale, either online or in store, in the past three years.\\n\\nThe sale is strictly online and will last for five days. It features new discounts each day across most of its clothing and accessories categories (men's, women's, and girl's), including its popular women's leggings that typically cost $90-plus. On Thursday morning, a pair of $128 leggings cost $79, for example.\\n\\nIn the past, analysts have applauded the company for resisting discounts while its competitors have leaned into them heavily.\\n\\nThe issue is that customers become hooked on discounts and are unwilling to pay full price, according to analysts. And in turn, heavy discounting eats into profit margins.\\n\\nThis has been one of the biggest issues to plague the retail sector in recent years as brands such as Gap and Victoria's Secret have used promotions to bring in customers. As a result, sales signs have become a mainstay in their stores in recent years.\\n\\nThis month's sale indicates that Lululemon is, like many of its competitors, reeling from the impact of having its stores closed for several months during the pandemic. While its online business has been strong in the past few months, sales were down 17% overall in the most recent quarter thanks to a lack of business at its brick-and-mortar stores.\\n\\n\\\"Given the Covid-19 pandemic, this is not surprising and makes sense as an avenue to reduce inventory as management said it would take various measures to ensure that inventory moved throughout the rest of the year without damaging the brand through persistent and widespread discounting,\\\" a group of Barclays analysts wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.\\n\\nThese analysts added that they would \\\"prefer\\\" a onetime warehouse sale over Lululemon holding on to \\\"stale inventory.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Warehouse sales have historically been an expeditious, margin-efficient, and lower-risk format to exit any excess inventory without permanently damaging brand equity. In fact, the Warehouse sales are so infrequent and short that we believe it gives customers access to this brand 'perk,' rather than being seen as damaging the brand through discounting,\\\" they said.\",\"61\":\"FORT MYERS-NAPLES, Fla.

Companies like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon have paused their facial recognition offers to law enforcement, citing human rights and ethical concerns, while lawmakers have proposed an indefinite national ban on facial recognition for police.\\n\\nDespite the public outcry against the technology, Clearview AI has doubled down, arguing that its facial recognition can help police, even offering its surveillance technology to help track the coronavirus pandemic.\",\"63\":\"Get ready for the biggest retailer battle of the century. Walmart Plus is a new membership program that will reportedly launch this month. The service will directly compete against Amazon Prime and if recent reports are accurate, it could undercut Amazon on price while offering similar perks.\\n\\nWalmart hasn't made any public comments about its service, but it has launched a Walmart Plus teaser website that indicates the service is \\\"almost here.\\\" The landing page also mentions \\\"saving money,\\\" so Walmart Plus is bound to include other perks, like deals and promos.\\n\\nAccording to Vox.com, Walmart Plus will launch this month. A Walmart spokesperson confirmed the membership offering and name to Tom's Guide, but declined to comment further. Here's what we've heard about Walmart Plus so far, and how it compares to Amazon Prime based on the latest leaks.\\n\\nWhat is Walmart Plus?\\n\\nWalmart Plus is a new subscription service that will reportedly include same-day delivery of groceries and other merchandise sold by Walmart.\\n\\nWalmart Plus appears to be a rebranding of Walmart's $98-per-year Grocery Unlimited service. The grocery delivery service launched last year and quickly expanded to 1,400 additional stores in September of 2019.\\n\\nHowever, the Walmart Plus landing page depicts groceries alongside tech, beauty, and sports products. So it seems as though Walmart Plus will include all sorts of products sold at Walmart. Vox also reports that the service will include early access to product deals and discounts on fuel at Walmart gas stations.\\n\\nThis is what the Walmart Plus service should offer based on the retailer's description. (Image credit: Walmart)\\n\\nAccording to the meta description for the Walmart Plus landing page, the service will offer free unlimited same-day delivery on groceries and thousands of other items. It also states that Walmart Plus will help members \\\"get even more benefits from your store to help you save money and live better.\\\"\\n\\nWalmart Plus price\\n\\nThe price of Walmart Plus has not been confirmed, but reports suggest that Walmart may stick with a $98 annual fee. This would be cheaper than Amazon's $119 annual cost for Amazon Prime. However, there could be different price tiers of Walmart Plus with different perks based on the tier consumers choose. There's no word on whether there will be a monthly option as well.\\n\\nWalmart Plus perks\\n\\nWalmart Plus will reportedly include same-day delivery of groceries and other products, reserved deliver slots, and limited access to Walmart's new Express two-hour delivery offering. You can also expect early access to deals on products and discounts on fuel at Walmart gas stations.\\n\\nThe earlier Vox report says that Walmart Plus may enable customers to use text messaging to place orders. Other perks could include discounts on prescription drugs. Plus, Walmart Plus members may be able to check out in Walmart Stores without waiting in line, building on the retailer's previous Scan & Go service.\\n\\nWalmart also reportedly has plans to add video entertainment to go up against Amazon Prime Video. Big partnerships could be on the way, but for now a family entertainment offering called CAMP by Walmart will be free to all Walmart app users this summer.\\n\\nFurthermore, it's no secret that Walmart and Amazon price match each other, especially on retail holidays like Amazon Prime Day. The renewed rivalry could make for excellent deals once Walmart Plus officially launches.\\n\\nWalmart Plus vs. Amazon\\n\\n(Image credit: Walmart)\\n\\nOnce the country's top retailer, Walmart has watched as Amazon has dominated online sales. Amazon now accounts for roughly 38% of all online retail sales in the U.S., according to eMarketer. By comparison, Walmart is a distant second place with just over 5% of the U.S. e-commerce market. The hope is that Walmart Plus will help it take some of that market share from Amazon.\\n\\nThis isn't the first time Walmart has taken on Amazon Prime. In 2015, Walmart launched ShippingPass, an unlimited online shipping service that cost $50 per year and promised deliveries in three days or less. This was Walmart's attempt to undercut Amazon Prime, which at the time cost $99 per year. Two years later, Walmart dropped its membership fee and switched to a 2-day free shipping program on orders of $35 or more.\\n\\nHowever, Walmart's biggest chest thump came in 2016, when it purchased Jet.com for $3 billion. The hope was that Jet.com would help Walmart establish a bigger online presence. (Walmart announced last month that it was permanently closing Jet.com).\\n\\nThe Walmart vs. Amazon feud continued into 2019. Just as Amazon announced its plans to offer 1-day shipping, Walmart followed suit with its own 1-day shipping pilot. Most recently, Walmart announced 2-hour Express delivery for an additional $10 over Walmart's typical delivery fees.\\n\\nEven on big retailer days like Black Friday, Walmart has shadowed Amazon with similar sales of its own like last holiday's Big Drop Sale. Walmart Plus is an extension of this ongoing battle and only time will tell if it's the true knockout punch that it needs to take on Amazon and its legion of subscribers.\",\"64\":\"SPRINGDALE, Ark.\\u2013\\u2013Deboning livestock and slicing up chickens has long been hands-on labor.

After all, the company's stock is now up by more than 2,500% year to date. Still, it may not be too late to buy shares of Novavax, as there are good reasons to believe this biotech stock can keep climbing. Here's one such reason to consider: The U.S. government recently awarded $1.6 billion in funding to Novavax as part of Operation Warp Speed. Novavax's shares jumped by more than 30% on this news. But could this lead to even more substantial gains for the company?\\n\\nA vote of confidence\\n\\nThe goal of Operation Warp Speed is to accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines and therapies for COVID-19. The aim is to have these products available for use by January 2021. The U.S. government initially selected 14 out of the more than 100 coronavirus vaccine candidates as part of this program, deeming these the most likely candidates to go on to earn regulatory approval. Novavax's potential vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is one of them.\\n\\nThe $1.6 billion the company received will help it fund a phase 3 clinical trial for NVX-CoV2373, which will enroll up to 30,000 participants and should start this fall. The company will also use the capital it received from Uncle Sam to ramp up the manufacturing of NVX-CoV2373. Novavax said it intends to deliver 100 million doses of the vaccine (pending regulatory approval) as early as late 2020.\\n\\nTempering our expectations\\n\\nBefore deciding to purchase shares of Novavax, it's essential to put a little more context around what's going on with the company. Here are two crucial things to consider. First, many other companies are partaking in Operation Warp Speed, and even beyond this select group, many others are racing to develop vaccines for COVID-19. In all likelihood, multiple vaccines will end up earning regulatory approval, and several companies will have to share this market. In other words, developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus may not turn out to be a particularly lucrative opportunity for Novavax. That is even if NVX-CoV2373 manages to make it through the clinical trial process, which, at this point, is far from certain.\\n\\nSecond, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently released an update regarding the standards it will follow when reviewing potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates. The health industry regulator does not plan on cutting corners just because of the urgency of the situation, and the criteria it outlined make it unlikely that any company will earn regulatory approval by year-end. For instance, to ensure the safety of a vaccine candidate, the FDA will require that companies monitor participants for at least six months after they have received the vaccine in question. With Novavax still a couple of months away (at best) from starting a phase 3 clinical trial, the company's goal to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine by late 2020 seems optimistic.\\n\\nShould you buy?\\n\\nNovavax has a lot of momentum going for it at the moment, and this momentum could continue to drive its stock price higher. In particular, if the company reports positive results for its ongoing phase 1\\/2 clinical trial, its stock will likely jump again. Novavax expects these results to come in by the end of July. On the flip side, negative results from a COVID-19-related clinical trial could sink the company's stock. Novavax does have another promising pipeline candidate, NanoFlu, a potential flu vaccine for people 65 and older.\\n\\nNovavax reported positive results from a phase 3 study for NanoFlu earlier this year, and this vaccine could go on to be a winner. But even with this caveat, Novavax seems a bit too risky. The company has yet to start a phase 3 study for NVX-CoV2373, not to mention the fact that the COVID-19 vaccine field is crowded. As such, only investors comfortable with the risk should consider initiating a small position in this biotech stock.\",\"66\":\"Walgreens Boots Alliance said Thursday that the pandemic hurt its fiscal third-quarter results as fewer people went to the doctor and got prescriptions and the company spent more to staff and clean stores.\\n\\nThe drugstore chain said its profits were dragged down primarily by the United Kingdom. They were also squeezed by increased sales of low-margin items, higher supply-chain costs and additional expenses for labor and store cleaning.\\n\\nWith the steep losses, Walgreens said it would cut more than 4,000 jobs in its Boots UK and Boots Opticians businesses in the United Kingdom, along with shutting 48 optician centers. That amounts to a 7% reduction of the workforce in those two parts of the company.\\n\\nWalgreens shares were down about 9% in recent trading Thursday.\\n\\nThe drugstore chain, which was already in the middle of an aggressive cost management effort, said it's now raising its annual cost-savings target to more than $2 billion by 2022. Company leaders said it will also double down on its existing strategies, including digital investments and a focus on adding health care services to its stores.\\n\\n\\\"What's important now is that we're taking swift action, both operationally and financially,\\\" Global Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said on an earnings call.\\n\\nHere's what Walgreens reported compared with what analysts were expecting for the third quarter ended May 31, based on Refinitiv data:\\n\\nEarnings per share: 83 cents, adjusted vs. $1.17 expected\\n\\nRevenue: $34.63 billion vs. $34.36 billion expected\\n\\nIn the third quarter, Walgreens posted net loss of $1.71 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with earnings of $1.03 billion, or $1.13 per share, a year earlier.\\n\\nThe loss in the latest quarter included 61 cents to 65 cents per share in Covid-19-related costs and impacts. With one-time adjustments, Walgreens earned 83 cents per share.\\n\\nSales rose slightly to $34.63 billion from $34.59 billion a year earlier. Walgreens said Covid-19 caused sales to be about $700 million to $750 million lower in the quarter, mostly because of a decline at its international stores.\\n\\nIts business in the United Kingdom particularly took a hit, which led to the job cuts. The company said footfall in Boots UK stores dropped by about 85% in April during stay-at-home orders, even as the stores were deemed essential retailers and remained open. In a news release, the company said its beauty and fragrance counters \\\"were effectively closed\\\" and more than 100 stores in places like airports were temporarily closed.\\n\\nStores in the U.S. fared better. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year were up 3% from the same period a year ago, beating expectations. Analysts predicted they would decline slightly by 0.2%, according to a StreetAccount consensus estimate.\\n\\nIn the pharmacy part of the stores, same-store sales rose by 3.5% compared with the same time last year. The company said brand inflation and an increase in specialty sales offset the drop in prescription volumes because of Covid-19. Same-store retail sales grew by 1.9% for the quarter, as there was strong customer demand for vitamins and protective equipment like masks.\\n\\nThe company said the U.S. business, which was a bright spot in the third quarter, is expected to have stronger sales in the next quarter but warned margins will be squeezed by pandemic-related factors, such as increased home deliveries.\\n\\nKehoe said Walgreens remains in a strong financial position, pointing to its free cash flow, its cost-savings program and new business opportunities.\\n\\nFor example, he said, Boots' online traffic skyrocketed as its foot traffic came nearly to a stop. He said it \\\"reached Black Friday levels on a daily basis\\\" with online sales up 120% in May and up even higher in June. However, he acknowledged that business comes with fulfillment costs that cut into profits.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Walgreens announced another new investment: A deal with VillageMD that will open doctor offices in 500 to 700 of its U.S. stores over the next five years.

The setup can be so expensive that just a handful of top players, like South Korea\\u2019s LG Chem Ltd., China\\u2019s CATL and Japan\\u2019s Panasonic Corp., can spend billions of dollars building a suitable factory.\\n\\nHorie\\u2019s innovation is to replace the battery\\u2019s basic components, which are metal-lined electrodes and liquid electrolytes, with a resin construction. He says this approach dramatically simplifies and speeds up manufacturing, making it as easy as \\u201cbuttering toast.\\u201d\\n\\nThe modification allows for 10-meter-long battery sheets to be stacked on top of each other \\u201clike seat cushions\\u201d to increase capacity, he said. Importantly, the resin-based batteries are also resistant to catching fire when punctured.\\n\\nIn March, APB raised \\u00a58 billion ($74 million), which is tiny by the wider industry\\u2019s standards but will be enough to fully equip one factory for mass production slated to start next year. Horie estimates the funds will get his plant in central Japan to 1 gigawatt-hour capacity by 2023.\\n\\nLithium-ion batteries have come a long way since they were first commercialized almost three decades ago. They last longer, pack more power and cost 85 percent less than they did 10 years ago, serving as the quiet workhorse driving the growth of smartphones and tablets with ever more powerful internals. But safety remains an issue and batteries have been the cause of fires in everything from Tesla Inc.\\u2019s cars to Boeing Co.\\u2019s Dreamliner jets and Samsung Electronics Co.\\u2019s smartphones.\\n\\n\\u201cJust from the standpoint of physics, the lithium-ion battery is the best heater humanity has ever created,\\u201d Horie said.\\n\\nIn a traditional battery, a puncture can create a surge measuring hundreds of amperes \\u2014 several times the current of electricity delivered to an average home. Temperatures can then shoot up to 700 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nAPB\\u2019s battery avoids such cataclysmic conditions by using a so-called bipolar design, doing away with present-day power bottlenecks and allowing the entire surface of the battery to absorb surges.\\n\\n\\u201cBecause of the many incidents, safety has been at the top of minds in the industry,\\u201d said Mitalee Gupta, senior analyst for energy storage at Wood Mackenzie. \\u201cThis could be a breakthrough for both storage and electric vehicle applications, provided that the company is able to scale up pretty quickly.\\u201d\\n\\nBut the technology is not without its shortcomings. Polymers are not as conductive as metal, and that could significantly impact the battery\\u2019s carrying capacity, according to Menahem Anderman, president of California-based Total Battery Consulting Inc.\\n\\nAlso, one drawback of the bipolar design is that cells are connected back-to-back in a series, making it difficult to control each one individually, Anderman said. He also questioned whether the cost savings would be sufficient to compete with the incumbents.\\n\\n\\u201cCapital is not killing the cost of a lithium-ion battery,\\u201d said Anderman. \\u201cLithium-ion with liquid electrolyte will remain the main application for another 15 years or more. It\\u2019s not perfect and it isn\\u2019t cheap, but beyond lithium-ion is a better lithium ion.\\u201d\\n\\nHorie acknowledges that APB can\\u2019t compete with battery giants who are already benefiting from economies of scale after investing billions. Instead of targeting the \\u201cred ocean\\u201d of the automotive sector, APB will first focus on stationary batteries used in buildings, offices and power plants.\\n\\nThat market will be worth $100 billion by 2025 worldwide \\u2014 more than five times its size last year \\u2014 according to estimates by Wood Mackenzie. The U.S. alone, which together with China will be the main source of increased energy storage demand, is likely to see a 10-fold increase to $7 billion in the period.\\n\\nHorie, 63, got his start with lithium-ion batteries at their very beginning. In February 1990, early on in his Nissan career, he started the automaker\\u2019s nascent research into electric and hybrid vehicles.\\n\\nJust a few weeks later, Sony Corp. shocked the industry \\u2014 which was betting on nickel-hydride technology \\u2014 by announcing plans to commercialize a lithium-ion alternative. Horie says he immediately saw the promise, and pushed for the two companies to combine research efforts that same year.\\n\\nBy 2000, however, Nissan was giving up on its battery business, having just been rescued by Renault SA. Horie had one shot at convincing his new boss, Carlos Ghosn, that electric vehicles were worth it.\\n\\nAfter a 28-minute presentation, a visibly excited Ghosn proclaimed Horie\\u2019s work an important investment and green-lit the project. Nissan\\u2019s Leaf would go on to become the best-selling electric vehicle for a decade.\\n\\nHorie came up with the idea for the all-polymer battery while still at Nissan, but wasn\\u2019t able to get institutional backing to make it real. In 2012, while teaching at the University of Tokyo, he was approached by Sanyo Chemical Industries Ltd., known for its superabsorbent materials used in diapers.\\n\\nTogether, the two developed the world\\u2019s first battery using a conductive gel polymer. In 2018, Horie founded APB, and Sanyo Chemical became one of his early investors.\\n\\nAPB has already lined up its first customer, a large Japanese company whose niche and high-value-added products sell mostly overseas, Horie said. He declined to give further details but said APB plans to make an announcement as soon as August.\\n\\n\\u201cThis will be the proof that our batteries can be mass-produced,\\u201d Horie said. \\u201cBattery makers have become assemblers. We are putting chemistry back into the lead role.\\u201d\",\"68\":\"Two brands of hand sanitizer are being recalled by their manufacturers due to methanol, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

But now there are signs that the pendulum could have swung a bit too far, with the markets beginning to experience shortages of key crude grades. Oil markets in backwardation\\n\\nA similar pattern is being observed for other sour crude grades, which are commanding premium prices even with global oil demand still 10% below normal levels.

Notably, Iraq cut just 38% of its promised cuts while Nigeria fared even worse, cutting a mere 19% of its commitments.
