Cases caught early have about a 90 per cent survival rate and may only require surgery, while cases caught at a later stage of development have a survival rate of between 5 and 10 per cent.\n\nProf Stassen also noted that his and other clinics are now facing \u201cdrastically reduced\u201d patient capacity due to social distancing measures and patients will have to be prioritised based on their case files.\n\nAs well as those with unchecked symptoms, patients who have recovered from the disease must be checked to ensure they do not develop a second case.\n\nIn the past 10-15 years, the management of oral cancer has greatly improved but, he said, \u201cCovid-19 has knocked us off our perch\u201d.\n\nLimerick dentist Dr Robert Bowe was alarmed to discover two mouth cancers in the first three weeks after he returned to regular practice; before that he had seen just one case in eight years.\n\n\u201cPeople had to put things off although we were open for emergencies and people could travel out of their areas and come to the dentist, but generally people were avoiding interactions,\u201d he said of recent months.\n\n\u201cMy point is, if I am seeing this as a dentist, what other things are being put off?\u201d\n\nOne of his patients had a mouth ulcer underneath a denture which went unchecked. Another had swelling around a tooth. On later inspection he was concerned by the pattern and took a scan which he sent on to a doctor. The patient was booked in for medical treatment the following day and had a biopsy which later confirmed B-cell lymphoma.\n\n\u201cThe message would be that if you have an ulcer that hasn\u2019t gone away after two weeks you should get it [checked],\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority that are investigated aren\u2019t anything to worry about but if it needs treatment, if it\u2019s picked up early it\u2019s much easier to treat.\u201d\n\nThe Irish Dental Association (IDA) recently warned that Ireland was facing an \u201cunprecedented crisis\u201d, following a survey of 329 practitioners on the fallout from Covid-19.\n\nAs well as addressing the financial difficulties experienced by practices, it noted the pandemic was impacting on people\u2019s ability to seek treatment.\n\nChief executive Fintan Hourihan noted that besides the impossibility of routine dentistry, many practitioners were unable to provide emergency care because of a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), a problem that has since somewhat abated.\n\n\u201cOral health is a key part of a person\u2019s overall health, and the effects of this outbreak will have repercussions that will last long after the virus has disappeared,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe bleak reality is that, unless supports are put in place for dentists, dental practices will close and patients will have to travel further for dental care and hospitals will be overwhelmed with emergency dental appointments.\u201d","articleSummary":"A high number of mouth cancers could be missed, or found late because people are unable, or less likely to go to their dentist during the Covid-19 crisis, dentists now warn.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a big problem,\u201d he said, noting that dentists were helping to discover between 150 and 180 cancers each year before the Covid-19 pandemic struck.\nProf Stassen identified two cases of mouth cancer during the lockdown when he was sent photographs of two concerned patients, but many patients are ignoring symptoms.\nMouth cancers are relatively common.\nLimerick dentist Dr Robert Bowe was alarmed to discover two mouth cancers in the first three weeks after he returned to regular practice; before that he had seen just one case in eight years."},"13":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"google-news-au","name":"Google News (Australia)"},"author":"Amy Remeikis, Melissa Davey","title":"Coronavirus Australia live update: Queensland to turn anyone from Victoria away at border as Melbourne enters lockdown","description":"The NSW premier is expected to announce new restrictions today as the state tries to contain \u2018high-risk situation\u2019.

According to the firm\u2019s new report on Quibi\u2019s early growth, the short-form video platform signed up about 910,000 users in its first few days back in April. Of those users, only about 72,000 stuck around after the three-month free trial, indicating the app had about an 8 percent conversion rate.\n\nThat\u2019s not too bad. But compare that to the streaming video industry\u2019s most successful debut of the last few years, Disney Plus, and the resulting picture is a grim one for Quibi, which has struggled both to find a hit among its mobile-centric shows and gain traction with its desired younger, TikTok-loving demographic, despite the surge in screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Sensor Tower, Disney managed to convert about 11 percent of the 9.5 million people the firm estimates signed up for Disney Plus in its first three days of availability in the US and Canada. Since then, Disney has added tens of millions more subscribers and now enjoys more than 50 million paying users as of April thanks in part of an international expansion.\n\nQuibi converted just 7 percent of the people who downloaded the app in its first three days\n\nThese numbers are not to be confused with the number of current paying subscribers Quibi has. While the company has yet to disclose that all-important figure, it has said that more than 5.6 million people have downloaded the app since April. We don\u2019t know how many people downloaded the app after its first few days and decided to then convert to a paid user after the free trial ended.\n\nSensor Tower also estimates only 4.5 million have downloaded Quibi in total. The discrepancy between that figure and Quibi\u2019s official one suggests Sensor Tower could also be far off in its estimates of how many users Quibi converted in its first three days. In a statement given to The Verge, a Quibi spokesperson said, \u201cthe number of paid subscribers is incorrect by an order of magnitude. To date, over 5.6 million people have downloaded the Quibi app. Our conversion from download to trial is above mobile app benchmarks, and we are seeing excellent conversion to paid subscribers \u2014 both among our 90-day free trial sign-ups from April, as well as our 14-day free trial sign-ups from May and June.\u201d\n\nThat said, Sensor Tower is a reputable analytics company known for reporting accurate estimates and, in absence of concrete figures from Quibi itself, the picture its report paints of the streaming service\u2019s business is not a rosy one. Sensor Tower\u2019s data also doesn\u2019t account for situations like an iPad user downloading Quibi, even though it\u2019s not optimized for anything but smartphone screens, or users deleting the app and downloading it again or onto a separate device, all situations that may lead to Quibi\u2019s larger total download figure.\n\nRegardless, it\u2019s not exactly controversial to say Quibi is not having a very great launch \u2014 co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg outright blamed the coronavirus for the app\u2019s early failures. Much has been written about the company\u2019s shortcomings, from the app\u2019s poor marketing and bad timing to the inability to share screenshots or captures on social media to Quibi\u2019s lack of smart TV or casting support at launch.\n\nMost importantly, the platform doesn\u2019t appear to have shows worth signing up for, like the mind-numbing amount of Netflix content that gets added each month or big pop culture events like Disney Plus\u2019 The Mandalorian. Quibi has no built-in install base, like HBO had for its recent launch of HBO Max, and it\u2019s an open question how long its $1.8 billion war chest will keep it afloat if users don\u2019t show up in greater numbers.","articleSummary":"Streaming service Quibi only managed to convert a little under 10 percent of its early wave of users into paying subscribers, says mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower.\nOf those users, only about 72,000 stuck around after the three-month free trial, indicating the app had about an 8 percent conversion rate.\nSensor Tower also estimates only 4.5 million have downloaded Quibi in total.\nThe discrepancy between that figure and Quibi\u2019s official one suggests Sensor Tower could also be far off in its estimates of how many users Quibi converted in its first three days.\nTo date, over 5.6 million people have downloaded the Quibi app."},"19":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"author":"Caitlin Conant","title":"2020 Daily Trail Markers: Jacksonville's COVID count rises in weeks before GOP convention","description":"President Trump says that the details surrounding the convention are \"flexible.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/2020-daily-trail-markers-jacksonvilles-covid-count-rises-in-weeks-before-gop-convention\/","urlToImage":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2019\/09\/14\/0458c21c-c9e7-478c-9478-413eed67a1e5\/thumbnail\/1200x630\/383f6ada006b2ab9baf5b7ff249c7262\/trail-markers-newsletter-620x254-v2.jpg","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T23:49:00+00:00","content":"When the Republican National Committee announced in mid-June that it had\u00a0chosen Jacksonville to host President Trump's nomination acceptance speech, Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, had a\u2026 [+16180 chars]","articleText":"When the Republican National Committee announced in mid-June that it had chosen Jacksonville to host President Trump's nomination acceptance speech, Duval County, where Jacksonville is located, had about 1,900 reported COVID-19 cases. Just over three weeks later, Jacksonville \u2014 as well as the state of Florida \u2014 is seeing record numbers of positive COVID-19 cases, and Duval County has surpassed 10,000 cases as the state has reopened and testing capacity has increased. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was among the first to announce his state would reopen amid concerns from experts who questioned whether it was too soon, and polls showing the public, too, harbored mixed feelings about reopening. Still, in June DeSantis said Florida could potentially host the convention, assuming that mitigation measures like face masks and testing would be in place. Now, with less than 50 days until the headliner event, Jacksonville has enacted a mandatory mask requirement, Florida is under a statewide executive order prohibiting facilities from operating at more than 50% capacity, and the Sunshine State now has had more than 200,000 COVID cases, the third most of any state, behind California and New York.\n\nThis week, President Trump told Gray Television's Greta Van Susteren that the details surrounding the convention are \"flexible.\" Convention officials have announced that attendees will be tested and have their temperatures checked daily. CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson and campaign reporters LaCrai Mitchell and Nicole Sganga report on the changing landscape in Jacksonville and throughout the state of Florida with less than two months until the event.\n\nFROM THE CANDIDATES\n\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nIn a 110-page document, the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders task forces released their recommendations on six major topics to nominee Biden and the Democratic National Committee, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Biden welcomed the months of work from six task forces which were made up of moderates and progressives. \"I commend the Task Forces for their service and helping build a bold, transformative platform for our party and for our country,\" Biden said in a statement specifically thanking Sanders for his leadership.\n\nSanders said Biden and he have \"strong disagreements\" but noted the \"end result\" of the recommendations document is \"a good policy blueprint that will move this country in a much-needed progressive direction\" even though he noted the final document \"is not what I or my supporters would have written alone.\"\n\nThe six areas covered by the document cover climate change, criminal justice reform, economy, education, health care, and immigration. Though the Biden campaign is releasing these recommendations, Biden has not committed to each recommendation, but he is expected to adopt some of these ideas. The CBS News political unit notes the document hews to Biden's advocacy of a healthcare public option, rather than \"Medicare for All.\" It favors using federal money to \"create a civilian corps of unarmed first responders\" to \"handle nonviolent emergencies\" so police officers can focus on more dangerous calls.\n\nOn climate change, the document contained a few timeline goals: By no later than 2050, the U.S. should achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, eliminate carbon pollution from power plants by 2035 and by 2030, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for all new buildings. On the economy, the document recommends that Biden pledge no cuts to Social Security benefits or changes to the retirement age, and on immigration, there is a recommendation for a \"100-day moratorium\" on deportations, pending a review of current practices under the Trump administration. The task force's recommendations on education mostly match Biden's previously released plans, but the group highly recommends Biden work for more unionizing for educators.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Biden was endorsed by Medicare-for-All activist Ady Barkan, who has ALS and formerly supported Elizabeth Warren and then Bernie Sanders. Explaining his public option health plan to Barkan, Biden suggested he would be able to \"quickly\" pass this plan, whatever the legislative realities are after the election. On police reform, Biden agreed with Barkan that \"absolutely\" a portion of police budgets could be redirected for different programs. Broadly, Biden opposes the total defunding of the police some of his fellow Democrats support. Later in the day, Biden also addressed the IBEW union, ridiculing Presidet Trump's displeasure with COVID-19 testing and general lack of interest in the death rate from the virus.\n\nAt a virtual fundraiser Tuesday evening Biden came to the defense of Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who has drawn criticism from both President Trump's campaign and Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Referring to her military service, Biden called questions about Duckworth's patriotism \"disgusting\" and \"sickening.\" His campaign is currently vetting Duckworth as a potential running mate. He's expected to announce his pick in early August.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP\n\nPresident Donald Trump's campaign rally in Tulsa \"more than likely contributed\" to a spike in new coronavirus cases, Tulsa City-County Health Department Director Dr. Bruce Dart said Wednesday during a press conference. \"We do have the highest number of cases. And we've had some significant cases these few past weeks that more than likely contributed to that,\" Dr. Dart said, referencing Tulsa County. \"We've seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, which is about right.\" Dr. Dart added that health officials are now left to \"just connect the dots.\" CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga and CBS News digital politics reporter Grace Segers report Tulsa's surge in coronavirus cases has outpaced all other cities in Oklahoma, including the more populous Oklahoma City. Tulsa County reported a one-day record high of 261 new cases on Monday, as well as 206 new cases, Tuesday.\n\n\"The President's rally was 18 days ago, all attendees had their temperature checked, everyone was provided a mask, and there was plenty of hand sanitizer available for all,\" Trump communications director Tim Murtaugh said, in part, in a statement to CBS News. \"It's obvious that the media's concern about large gatherings begins and ends with Trump rallies.\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters Wednesday she did not have data from Tulsa, Oklahoma, adding, \"It's the decision of individuals whether to go. We encourage the wearing of masks.\" The Trump campaign will encourage, but not require, mask-wearing at the president's upcoming rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The president's reelection team will also mandate that all campaign staff wear masks inside the rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Saturday night. In a press conference, Tuesday, Governor Sununu told reporters, \"We hear from the Trump campaign that they'll be there wearing masks.\" Multiple GOP sources confirmed the Trump campaign staff requirement to CBS News. \"All campaign staff are instructed to wear masks and were in Tulsa as well,\" director of press communications Erin Perrine told CBS News.\n\nVEEPSTAKES\n\nTAMMY DUCKWORTH\n\nVoteVets, a liberal veterans' group, released a video this morning defending Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth after Fox News host Tucker Carlson's comments smearing the senator. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman says the organization has released videos encouraging presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to select Duckworth as his running mate. The video features footage of Carlson as the narrator says, \"[President Donald Trump] sicced Tucker Carlson in a suicide mission to take her down\" and that Duckworth is \"tough as hell.\"\n\nDuckworth also released a statement on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's retirement. Duckworth announced her intention last week to block the promotions of 1,123 senior U.S. Armed Forces officials until Defense Secretary Mark Esper gave her written confirmation that he will not block the \"expected and deserved promotion of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman to Colonel.\" In a statement Duckworth said, \"Secretary Esper's failure to protect his troops sets a new, dark precedent that any Commander in Chief can interfere with routine merit-based military promotions to carry out personal vendettas and retaliation against military officers who follow duly-authorized subpoenas while upholding their oath of office and core principles of service.\" Vindman was a witness and testified in the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.\n\nISSUES THAT MATTER\n\nEDUCATION\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT) launched a $1 million TV and digital ad buy Wednesday, calling on the Senate to return and pass more funding for schools to reopen safely in the fall. AFT said schools need at least $116.5 billion to accommodate PPE, cleaning supplies, hybrid distance learning, transportation and other aspects of a fall reopening.\n\n\"Why are Senate Republicans taking a vacation instead of passing funding to safely reopen schools and kick start our economy?\" the ad asks. \"We can't afford for our children's education to be another victim of the coronavirus. Tell your senator to come back to Washington and support emergency education funding.\" CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro says the ads will be running for two weeks on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News in D.C. and 10 states: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.\n\nSTATE-BY-STATE\n\nCALIFORNIA\n\nAll of California's Democratic state legislators announced today their support of 2020 Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, reports CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar. The 29 Democratic state senators and 61 assembly members represent more than 28 million Californians and make up more than two-thirds of the state legislature. The Biden campaign called the move an \"unprecedented show of support\" and said it is the first time that members of both houses of the California legislature have come together in a joint show of support for a Presidential candidate.\" State Senate President Pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins said senate Democrats in California \"fall all along the political spectrum,\" and underscored the group's strong belief in Biden. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon echoed those remarks, saying in a statement that \"with President Joe Biden there is daylight visible, and an opportunity for unity, recovery and new growth.\"\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nNorth Carolina Governor Roy Cooper has ordered that all flags at state facilities be lowered to half-staff in remembrance of the late former State Senator Katie G. Dorsett, who was the first Black woman to hold a cabinet position in the state's legislature. Dr. Dorsett passed away Tuesday.\n\n\"Katie Dorsett was a dedicated public servant and inspiration as the first African American woman to hold a cabinet position in North Carolina,\" said Cooper in a tweet Tuesday. \"Her work in the state senate and Department of Administration paved the way for future leaders, and she'll be deeply missed.\"\n\nBorn in Mississippi, CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says Dorsett spent much of her adult life in North Carolina where she taught at North Carolina A&T for more than three decades before going on to serve as a Guilford county commissioner and later the secretary of the North Carolina Department of Administration, making her the first Black woman to serve in a cabinet post in the state's history. Even before this milestone, Dorsett had made history when she became the first Black woman to serve on the Greensboro City Council. From 2003-2010, Dorsett served in the North Carolina Senate and in 2010, she was inducted into the state's Women's Hall of Fame. State flags will remain at half-staff in her honor through Friday.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL COVERAGE\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nEducator Amy Kennedy and former construction CEO David Richter were the most notable winners in New Jersey's House primaries Tuesday, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. In the 2nd District, Kennedy, who is married to former Congressman Patrick Kennedy, a scion of the American political dynasty, quickly cruised through her Democratic primary and will face off against Republican Congressman Jeff Van Drew, who switched parties after flipping the seat in 2018. Mr. Trump won this South Jersey district by five points in 2016. An internal poll by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee showed Kennedy trailing Van Drew by 3 points, and Biden trailing by 1 point to Mr. Trump in the district. The poll was conducted from June 30 to July 3.\n\nIn the 3rd District, Richter beat former Burlington county legislator Katie Gibbs and is the Republican nominee who will run against Democratic incumbent Andy Kim. While Kim's seat has been targeted by national Republicans, he's been able to keep a consistent fundraising streak and has $3.5 million cash on hand. In an election night statement, Richter said while he expects to be outspent in the general, he called Kim \"a Nancy Pelosi puppet, part of the radical left and a terrible fit for our district, one that voted for President Trump in 2016 and is going to do so again in 2020.\"\n\nAnother notable result, Democrat Josh Gottheimer easily fended off his progressive challenger, local councilwoman Arati Kreibich. Kreibich received late support from Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley. She said in her concession statement she'd be voting for Gottheimer.\n\nIN THE SENATE\n\nHeading into the summer, Democratic Senate hopefuls are raising record amounts of cash in their bids to unseat Republican Senate incumbents, CBS News political unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice and Eleanor Watson report. The massive fundraising hauls are pouring in despite the ongoing economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAccording to Amy McGrath's campaign, the retired fighter pilot raised $17.4 million from April through June in her primary bid to unseat Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. The average donation was $39. This comes just after McGrath eked out a win in the June 23rd primary in a closer than expected race against Charles Booker. Cook Political Report currently ranks the race as \"likely Republican.\"\n\nWhile second-quarter numbers have not yet been filed, the Kentucky Senate race is already one of the most expensive Senate races in the 2020 cycle so far. For context, the Texas Senate race was one of the most expensive Senate contests of 2018. In the second quarter of that year, then Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke brought in just over $10 million in his bid against Senator Ted Cruz. McGrath's fundraising number is also more than was raised by multiple presidential candidates during the 2019 fundraising quarters, including the amount raised by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden during the fall quarter. According to Kantar\/Campaign Analysis Group tracking, McGrath has spent $15 million on advertising in her race to date.\n\nMeanwhile, in another ranked \"likely Republican,\" Democratic Senate candidate Jaime Harrison in South Carolina has raised almost $14 million in his bid against Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. While Graham has not yet released his second-quarter fundraising number, Harrison raised nearly double what he raised during the first quarter of the year, when he broke South Carolina fundraising records and outraised the incumbent senator.\n\nDemocratic candidates in more competitive races have continued their run of impressive fundraising since the start of the year.\n\nRead more here.\n\nGEORGIA\n\nSenator David Perdue of Georgia released his first two television ads of the cycle on Wednesday, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. In the first ad called \"City on the Hill,\" Perdue said, \"It's up to us to protect what the rest of the world envies: economic opportunity for everybody, limited government, individual liberty.\" In the second ad, Perdue said there is a need for police reform but not \"Defund the Police.\" He cites measures like body cameras, de-escalation training, and recruiting so that officers look more like the communities they serve. Perdue is taking on Democrat Jon Ossoff in November.","articleSummary":"Though the Biden campaign is releasing these recommendations, Biden has not committed to each recommendation, but he is expected to adopt some of these ideas.\nThe Trump campaign will encourage, but not require, mask-wearing at the president's upcoming rally in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\nIn a press conference, Tuesday, Governor Sununu told reporters, \"We hear from the Trump campaign that they'll be there wearing masks.\"\n\"Her work in the state senate and Department of Administration paved the way for future leaders, and she'll be deeply missed.\"\nFrom 2003-2010, Dorsett served in the North Carolina Senate and in 2010, she was inducted into the state's Women's Hall of Fame."},"20":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"cbs-news","name":"CBS News"},"author":"CBS News","title":"Democratic Senate candidates smash fundraising records in 2nd quarter despite pandemic","description":"Democratic Senate hopefuls are raising record amounts of cash in their bids to unseat Republican Senate incumbents.","url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/democratic-senate-candidates-fundraising-records-second-quarter-pandemic\/","urlToImage":"https:\/\/cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com\/hub\/i\/r\/2020\/06\/30\/0af936a3-b983-48db-a292-2107cec3ca92\/thumbnail\/1200x630g2\/3a138d0cbe900e40fe11b80908c34ef7\/amy-mcgrath-1064412608.jpg","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T23:48:16+00:00","content":"Heading into the summer, Democratic Senate hopefuls are raising record amounts of cash in their bids to unseat Republican Senate incumbents.

In two of the top targeted seats for Democrats, candidates raked in more than $7 million. In Maine, Sara Gideon raised $9 million from April through June, about $2 million more than she raised in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nAt the same time, Cal Cunningham, in North Carolina, pulled in $7.4 million, about $3 million more than he raised in the first quarter in his race against incumbent GOP Senator Thom Tillis. The North Carolina race is shaping up to be the most expensive in terms of advertising so far, with outside groups, party committees and candidates having already spent or reserved more than $106 million for ads leading up to November.\n\nDemocrats are also increasingly eyeing Montana and Iowa as potential pick-up opportunities, and the candidates in those states are bringing in the money to support a contest. Governor Steve Bullock's campaign said he raised $7.7 million in his race against Republican Senator Steve Daines, and businesswoman Theresa Greenfield brought in $6 million, according to her campaign, against Republican Senator Joni Ernst in Iowa.\n\nIn Kansas, Democratic Senate candidate Dr. Barbara Bollier raised $3.7 million. According to her campaign, it's the largest single-quarter filing of any candidate \u2014 federal or state \u2014 in Kansas history. Bollier is seeking to fill the seat being vacated by outgoing GOP Senator Pat Roberts, who announced he would not seek reelection last year. The Kansas Senate primary election will take place on August 4.\n\nEven in states like Georgia and Texas that analysts consider as likely to remain Republican, the Democratic candidates are pulling in more cash than previous presidential candidates. In Georgia, Reverend Raphael Warnock's campaign said he raised nearly $3 million in his campaign to challenge Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler, and Jon Ossoff reported raising more than $3.4 million in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue. M.J. Hegar in Texas is competing in a runoff next week against State Senator Royce West to take on Republican Senator John Cornyn. Hegar's campaign reports she raised $1.7 million.\n\nCampaigns for other top-tier Democratic candidates like Mark Kelly in Arizona and John Hickenlooper in Colorado have not yet released their numbers for the latest fundraising quarter but have brought in large cash hauls in the past.\n\nWhile Democrats are touting their record-breaking fundraising for the second quarter, the Republicans they're challenging have not yet released totals.

As the province slowly reopens and welcomes more travellers from elsewhere in Atlantic Canada, anxiety is high that new cases might appear \u2013 similar to a new cluster linked to nightclubs in Quebec.\n\nBars owners on George Street, the kind of place where live music rolls out of every other door and where you can get three Jagerbombs for $10, say it\u2019s difficult to control what happens outside their clubs. City officials, who say it\u2019s up to the province to enforce public-health rules, are installing a fence to restrict access to George Street in advance of this weekend.\n\nHealth Minister John Haggie said the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation is investigating the overcrowding complaints, and said some bars may lose their liquor licences.\n\n\u201cIt really is a shame because it jeopardizes all of us,\u201d Mr. Haggie said at a Wednesday news conference.\n\nNewfoundlanders haven\u2019t forgotten the COVID-19 outbreak that struck the province in March, after an infected person from out of province visited a St. John\u2019s funeral home and sparked a cluster of more than 120 cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only starting to take our first tentative steps toward normalcy.

There have been at least 51 confirmed cases and three deaths tied to the church, local health officials said.\n\nCharles Hiser, 82, was the first of three churchgoers to die after contracting the virus.\n\nHis daughter, Libby Morgan, said her father had lived alone and had spent the last few months cooped up at home to stay safe. She brought him groceries and talked to him regularly on the phone so he was not lonely. But Mr. Hiser missed going to Graystone Baptist, where he had attended services for 30 years or so, his daughter said. So as soon as regular services resumed, he went right back, eschewing a mask.\n\nWithin two weeks, he had tested positive for the virus.\n\n\u201cI felt like, gosh, I was thinking he\u2019d be safe there,\u201d Ms. Morgan said. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re in church. Just like a child that goes to school is supposed to feel safe.\u201d\n\nThe church is now reopened, again, after a two-week closure.\n\nThere were just six recorded cases of the coronavirus in Union County, in rural northeastern Oregon, when Lighthouse United Pentecostal Church announced its reopening on May 22 in an Instagram post that also cited Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks about reopening churches.\n\nNow, the county has recorded 356 cases, many of them traced to the church.\n\nThe outbreak is thought to have been seeded by a wedding there, which drew attendees from out of town, said Dan Satterwhite, a pastor at an affiliated Lighthouse Church in the neighboring town of Pendleton.

I think what Vanessa Guill\u00e9n's disappearance and death has done has energized this silent majority of survivors who were afraid to come forward and now they are speaking out because they know the consequences. They want to honor Vanessa.\"\n\n\"The military has a horrible track record of abuse of people who do speak out. And it's time for the military to seriously grapple with its own failures of handling sexual assault and sexual harassment,\" he added.\n\nDespite efforts from the Department of Defense to address sexual assault, the amount of reports increased by 3% in fiscal year 2019, according to an annual review from the DOD released in April of this year. An anonymous survey released last year showed sexual assault in the military spiked nearly 40% in 2018. The report estimated 20,500 service members experienced some kind of \"contact or penetrative sexual assault\" that year.\n\nSpecialist Guill\u00e9n, 20, went missing from the base on April 22. Following national pressure led by her family, activists and congress members, the Army began to treat the case as a criminal investigation on June 24 after suspecting foul play. Human remains were found almost a week later and the Army confirmed they belong to Guill\u00e9n on Monday.\n\nSpecialist Aaron Robinson and a woman identified as his girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar, have been identified as suspects in the case. Aguilar told investigators that Robinson said he killed Guill\u00e9n by hitting her in the head with a hammer, and that the pair later disposed of her body, according to the criminal complaint filed against Aguilar. Robinson ran away from Fort Hood and died by suicide as police were closing in on him, local authorities said.\n\nFamily lawyer Natalie Khawam accused Robinson of sexually harassing Guill\u00e9n. Khawam said Sunday the military sexual harassment is an \"epidemic\" and demands attention from Congress. \"You can't turn a blind eye anymore,\" she said.\n\nThe handling of the case has spurred calls for an independent investigation. Texas congresswoman Sylvia Garcia, who has been the leading public figure alongside the Guill\u00e9n family, is one of 88 members of Congress requesting a probe by the acting Department of Defense inspector general Sean O'Donnell.\n\nToday, 87 of my colleagues joined me in expressing support for @RepSpeier and @SenGillibrand\u2019s request for the @DeptofDefense Acting Inspector General to conduct an independent investigation into Fort Hood\u2019s handling of SPC Vanessa Guillen\u2019s case.#JusticeForVanessaGuillen pic.twitter.com\/5mZJa4A2iF \u2014 Rep.

He said he was confident that his business would survive the lockdown, but it was difficult to prove that to potential buyers.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine from a purchaser's perspective, they don\u2019t know that [we will survive the crisis], and it is a legitimate question to ask, 'If you guys fold, how likely will we be able to lease 3,000 square metres on Chapel Street?' The answer is, with a lot of difficulty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Chapel Street precinct, which runs from South Yarra in the north, through Prahran to Windsor in the south, is one of the busiest shopping, dining and nightlife districts in Australia.\n\nBefore the last lockdown between March and May, it had been one of the areas with the highest number of COVID-19 infections. But the latest outbreak has not yet spread to this end of the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChrissie Maus, general manager of the Chapel Street Precinct Association,which represents more than 2000 businesses in the area, agreed there was little choice but to enforce a second lockdown.\n\nBut she said those at the top should take responsibility, and called for Premier Andrews to resign.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t trust [Mr Andrews'] government to effectively manage this, given the hotel quarantine debacle. But not only that. The fact he won\u2019t answer questions on his leadership.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, anyone needs to admit their faults. The fact he can\u2019t stand there and admit he has driven this state into billions of dollars of more debt is very concerning. I feel like he has to fall on his sword because the trust has gone,\" she said.\n\nShe said businesses on Chapel Street had been doing the right thing, with rigorous hygiene practices and social distancing. But she said the botched hotel quarantining system was forcing them to pay a heavy cost through no fault of their own.\n\n\u201cThis next round will be a massive kick in the guts,\" she said. \"And I have no doubt there is going to be huge economic fall out, frustration and community devastation. Heartbreakingly, some businesses won\u2019t survive.\"\n\nChris Lutz, owner of Design a Space, a business that provides fashion designers with a bricks-and-mortar retail space to sell their clothes and other fashion products, was positive about the prospects of surviving the latest lockdown. \"We\u2019ve never worked harder for the business in order to survive,\" he said.\n\n\"The first lock down was very much a shock for everyone. We didn't know how we would get through it. We were closed for a period of five weeks and revenue went down to zero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"But we did manage to generate some sales for our designers online and through instagram,\" he said. Staff were stood down but kept on the books thanks to the federal government's Job Keeper program.\n\nUnder the current lockdown rules, retailers are allowed to stay open, and Mr Lutz said the plan was to keep his three stores \u2013 one on Chapel Street, one in the Melbourne CBD, and on in Fitzroy \u2013 open throughout.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s work for our staff to continue doing, and with all the measures that we are trying to employ with regard to social distancing, hand sanitiser, frequently cleaning surfaces, we\u2019re at this stage planning on remaining open,\" he said\n\nHe said he was disappointed the Victorian government hadn't used the military to control the hotel quarantine system. \"It\u2019s sad that it stemmed from a few people doing the wrong thing, and now the impact is far reaching and devastating across all industries.\"","articleSummary":"He said he was concerned the latest lockdown could prompt more to follow.\nThe Chapel Street precinct, which runs from South Yarra in the north, through Prahran to Windsor in the south, is one of the busiest shopping, dining and nightlife districts in Australia.\nAdvertisementChrissie Maus, general manager of the Chapel Street Precinct Association,which represents more than 2000 businesses in the area, agreed there was little choice but to enforce a second lockdown.\nBut she said those at the top should take responsibility, and called for Premier Andrews to resign.\nShe said businesses on Chapel Street had been doing the right thing, with rigorous hygiene practices and social distancing."},"33":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"msnbc","name":"MSNBC"},"author":"MSNBC","title":"All In with Chris Hayes on MSNBC","description":"Get the latest news, video, and commentary from Chris Hayes, and join All In\u2019s community.","url":"https:\/\/www.msnbc.com\/all","urlToImage":"https:\/\/media4.s-nbcnews.com\/j\/newscms\/2018_34\/2539371\/all_in_with_chris_hayes-social-avatar_1200x6301x_a769760b79c8bb61763d6e41914d7560.nbcnews-fp-1200-630.png","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T23:37:27.4869249Z","content":null,"articleText":"All In Extra: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has an extended conversation with MSNBC's Chris Hayes and audience members as part of \"The Green New Deal\" special.

Reuters reported that Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy had both approved him for promotion in a list that was \u201cdue to be sent to the White House in the coming days,\u201d according to a senior U.S. defense official.\n\nThe official told Reuters that Esper approved the list on Monday with Vindman\u2019s name.\n\nDespite that, Vindman announced on Twitter he was retiring: \u201cToday I officially requested retirement from the US Army, an organization I love.

Col. Vindman, nor has the Secretary confirmed whether he sent that list to the White House for review.

Wochit\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's first large campaign event since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdowns, along with protests at the time, were \"likely\" a contributing factor in a recent surge of cases in Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to a local top health official.\n\nTulsa Health Department Executive Director Bruce Dart said at a news conference Wednesday that it was \"more than likely\" the large gatherings in the last few weeks added to a record number of cases reported this week.\n\nThe county saw a record 261 new cases of the virus Monday \u2013 just over two weeks after Trump's rally \u2013 with an additional 206 on Tuesday, according to the Tulsa Health Department. The incubation period for the coronavirus is thought by experts to be between two and 14 days.\n\n\"The past few days we've had almost 500 cases, and we know we had several large events a little over two weeks ago, which is about right, so I guess we just connect the dots,\" Dart said, citing Trump's rally and \"other protests.\"\n\nThe rally, held at Tulsa's BOK Center on June 20, drew some 6,200 Trump attendees and was met with hundreds of protesters. The rally also occurred as cities across the nation, including Tulsa, were the sites of massive marches against racism and police brutality. Also in Tulsa at the time was an outdoor Juneteenth celebration at Oklahoma State University-Tulsa.\n\nAnother campaign rally Saturday: Doctors worry about coronavirus risks at Trump's New Hampshire rally\n\nTim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump campaign, said in a statement that the news media was disproportionately focused on Trump's events in the spread of the virus.\n\n\"There were no health precautions to speak of as thousands looted, rioted, and protested in the streets and the media reported that it did not lead to a rise in coronavirus cases,\" Murtaugh said. \"Meanwhile, the President\u2019s rally was 18 days ago, all attendees had their temperature checked, everyone was provided a mask, and there was plenty of hand sanitizer available for all. It\u2019s obvious that the media\u2019s concern about large gatherings begins and ends with Trump rallies.\"\n\nThe campaign has said that it provided attendees with face masks, but did not require them to be worn, which left the majority of rallygoers maskless that evening. Trump has resisted wearing a face mask in public, while the White House says masks are a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, not a requirement.\n\nWho should encourage wearing masks?: The White House has sent conflicting messages on masks, new coronavirus cases\n\nAhead of the Trump rally, Dart recommended that the event be postponed due to the risk of spreading the virus. He said at the time that he welcomed Trump's visit, \"but not during a pandemic.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019m concerned about our ability to protect anyone who attends a large, indoor event, and I\u2019m also concerned about our ability to ensure the president stays safe as well,\" he said before the rally.\n\nIn the week after the rally, a reporter who had been present tested positive for the virus, the Associated Press reported. Last week former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and Trump campaign official Kimberly Guilfoyle, who were both present at the Tulsa rally, also tested positive. The president and those around him are routinely tested for the virus.\n\n\"This is very sad. We need a president who cares about other human beings again,\" said Andrew Bates, a Joe Biden campaign spokesperson, in a tweet about Dart's comments on Wednesday.\n\nContributing: David Jackson, Nicholas Wu, Courtney Subramanian\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/politics\/2020\/07\/08\/trumps-tulsa-rally-protests-led-covid-spike-health-official-says\/5401944002\/","articleSummary":"CLOSE During the rally, President Trump touted his success during the pandemic, saying he saved hundreds of thousands of lives.\nWochitWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's first large campaign event since the beginning of the coronavirus lockdowns, along with protests at the time, were \"likely\" a contributing factor in a recent surge of cases in Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to a local top health official.\nThe county saw a record 261 new cases of the virus Monday \u2013 just over two weeks after Trump's rally \u2013 with an additional 206 on Tuesday, according to the Tulsa Health Department.\n\"There were no health precautions to speak of as thousands looted, rioted, and protested in the streets and the media reported that it did not lead to a rise in coronavirus cases,\" Murtaugh said.\nLast week former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain and Trump campaign official Kimberly Guilfoyle, who were both present at the Tulsa rally, also tested positive."},"39":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"financial-times","name":"Financial Times"},"author":null,"title":"White House warns railroad pension agency over China investments","description":"Administration officials caution Railroad Retirement Board over \u2018unnecessary economic risk\u2019","url":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/326ef7d5-5ad3-4352-95b7-4d072590a648","urlToImage":"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/__origami\/service\/image\/v2\/images\/raw\/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F838febb7-0768-427c-b421-6312e547757b.jpg?source=next-opengraph&fit=scale-down&width=900","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T23:22:23.4446341Z","content":"The White House has warned the Railroad Retirement Board, a federal agency, that its investments in Chinese assets are an \u201cunnecessary economic risk\u201d that pose a national security threat to America.\r\u2026 [+2534 chars]","articleText":"Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more.","articleSummary":"Gain a global perspective on the US and go beyond with curated news and analysis from 600 journalists in 50+ countries covering politics, business, innovation, trends and more."},"40":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"buzzfeed","name":"Buzzfeed"},"author":"Salvador Hernandez","title":"Transcripts Show George Floyd Told Cops He Couldn't Breathe More Than 20 Times","description":"\"Tell my kids I love them.

In response, Ford CEO Jim Hackett has told employees in a letter that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201ccontroversial that the Ford Police Interceptor helps officers do their job\u201d and that Ford will continue the business.\n\nThe internal discussion, which Ford confirmed to The Verge, comes as the country is gripped by national movements for racial justice and against police brutality that were sparked by the killing of George Floyd.\n\nFord is far and away the leading automaker in the US when it comes to making and selling specially-designed vehicles for law enforcement, making up some two-thirds of the market. While it\u2019s not a big source of the company\u2019s annual revenue (which was $156 billion in 2019), Ford has long maintained that its overall lineup benefits from new technologies that get tested in the police vehicles (like hybrid electric drivetrains, for example).\n\n\u201cOur resources can and should be diverted to other forms of first response and public safety\u201d\n\nThe national protests, though, have inspired some Ford employees to rethink the company\u2019s relationship with police. The issue has been brought up at recent town hall meetings, and now employees \u2014 including Black workers who are part of Ford\u2019s African Ancestry Network (FAAN) employee resource group \u2014 have circulated a letter asking the company to \u201ccease development, production, and sale of all custom police vehicles and products.\u201d\n\nOther employees have since signed onto the letter (though it\u2019s unclear how many) and they want the company to take some kind of action by July 15th, according to Jalopnik. \u201cOur resources can and should be diverted to other forms of first response and public safety,\u201d the employees wrote.\n\nRelated Ford asked the government about giving police cars an off switch for mandatory EV noise rule\n\nThe seemingly endless footage of police violence captured across the last few months has caused a reckoning in some industries, especially tech. Nextdoor stopped a program that allowed users to forward posts to law enforcement. Amazon even announced it will stop allowing police to use its facial recognition technology for a year, and Microsoft has made a similar pledge. This all came after employees across the tech industry have spent the last year pushing back against their companies\u2019 contracts with government agencies, too.\n\nBut the same couldn\u2019t really be said for the transportation industry (save for bike companies, which are split on the matter), even though some of the most horrific videos to go viral in the last two months featured protestors being run over by Ford police vehicles.\n\nThis is one reason why employees inside Ford are now arguing that the company should sever its relationship with police. \u201cWe cannot claim to support the fight against systemic racism while supplying and supporting the very systems that perpetrate violence against Black Americans,\u201d the group wrote, according to Jalopnik.\n\nThey continued:\n\nThroughout our history, the vehicles that Ford employees design and build have been used as accessories to police brutality and oppression. We know that while many join, support, or supply law enforcement with good intentions, these racist policing practices that plague our society are historic and systemic \u2014 a history and system perpetuated by Ford for over 70 years \u2014 ever since Ford introduced the first-ever police package in 1950. As an undeniable part of that history and system, we are long overdue to \u201cthink and act differently\u201d on our role in racism.\n\nWhen Hackett publicly addressed the nationwide protests in early June, he said \u201c[t]here are no easy answers,\u201d and that Ford is \u201cnot interested in superficial actions.\u201d Hackett said that \u201c[t]his is our moment to lead from the front and fully commit to creating the fair, just and inclusive culture that our employees deserve.\u201d\n\nBut in his internal letter to employees, Hackett defended the company\u2019s business of making vehicles for police. And he argued that Ford\u2019s police cars, SUVs, and trucks could make those police officers \u201csafer and more accountable\u201d \u2014 though without going into detail:\n\nThe issues plaguing police credibility have nothing to do with the vehicles they\u2019re driving. In fact, as we imagine the future power of our connected vehicles, smarter Ford vehicles can be used to not only improve officers\u2019 ability to protect and serve, but also provide data that can make police safer and more accountable. Just think, dating back to the Model T, Ford has more than 100 years in serving first responders and that leadership over the decades has been earned by co-developing our purpose-built vehicles and technologies with police and emergency agencies to make our vehicles the number one choice.\n\nHackett also said that taking away Ford\u2019s specially-built vehicles \u201cwould be doing harm to [police officers\u2019] safety and making it harder for them to do their job.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, this is why, given our insights, new capabilities and leadership, I believe these unfortunate circumstances present Ford with an even greater opportunity to not only innovate new solutions but also leverage our unique position to support the dialogue and reform needed to create safer communities for all,\u201d Hackett wrote.\n\nHe wrapped his letter by thanking employees for speaking up, but saying that Ford won\u2019t change course. \u201cI do appreciate people speaking their mind to me on this issue \u2013 it helped me generate this note to explain why we are continuing our commitment to police forces all over the world in our trusted products,\u201d he said.\n\nFord declined to comment beyond Hackett\u2019s letter.","articleSummary":"Employees inside Ford have asked the company\u2019s leadership to stop making and selling police vehicles, according to Jalopnik.\n\u201cOur resources can and should be diverted to other forms of first response and public safety\u201dThe national protests, though, have inspired some Ford employees to rethink the company\u2019s relationship with police.\nThis is one reason why employees inside Ford are now arguing that the company should sever its relationship with police.\nThey continued:Throughout our history, the vehicles that Ford employees design and build have been used as accessories to police brutality and oppression.\nHe wrapped his letter by thanking employees for speaking up, but saying that Ford won\u2019t change course."},"50":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"breitbart-news","name":"Breitbart News"},"author":"David Ng","title":"Neil Young Unleashes Song Ripping Trump: \u2018We Got to Vote Him Out\u2019","description":"Rock musician Neil Young said he won't sue President Donald Trump for using his music during campaign rallies, saying that he would rather the president focus on saving lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.\u00a0But Young also taunted the president by suggesting hi\u2026","url":"http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/entertainment\/2020\/07\/08\/neil-young-unleashes-song-ripping-trump-we-got-to-vote-him-out\/","urlToImage":"https:\/\/media.breitbart.com\/media\/2020\/02\/neilyoungtrump1-640x335.jpg","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T23:10:33Z","content":"Rock musician Neil Young said he won\u2019t sue President Donald Trump for using his music during campaign rallies, saying that he would rather the president focus on saving lives amid the coronavirus pan\u2026 [+2179 chars]","articleText":"Rock musician Neil Young said he won\u2019t sue President Donald Trump for using his music during campaign rallies, saying that he would rather the president focus on saving lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Premier Doug Ford wants more federal funding set aside for Ontario. The Canadian Press\n\nOntario won\u2019t settle for a \u201cbad deal\u201d when it comes to billions in required financial aid for municipalities, Premier Doug Ford said Wednesday, as the rift between the province and federal government over desperately needed civic funding appeared to widen.\n\nMr. Ford said he is involved in active talks with Ottawa to secure funding for municipalities strapped for cash due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMunicipal leaders said earlier this week that an aid package from both upper levels of government is needed to prevent tax increases and service cuts.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Premier said he is not willing to settle for the current federal offer because it is more than a billion dollars short of what\u2019s needed to help shore up Ontario communities.\n\n\u201cIf I walked away, the municipalities wouldn\u2019t be too happy with the amount that the federal government\u2019s offering right now,\u201d Mr. Ford said.\n\nThe Premier said Ontario represents 38 per cent of Canada\u2019s population, and he believes it should receive the equivalent to that in the federal deal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t rush a bad deal,\u201d he said.\n\nSome municipalities have expressed frustration in recent months that they are stuck in the middle of a lingering standoff between the federal and Ontario governments over the aid package.\n\nThe municipal leaders have said $10-billion is needed for communities across the country, including Ontario, and federal and provincial governments must resolve their differences before cuts and fee hikes are needed.\n\nA spokeswoman for Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government recognizes municipalities face serious financial pressures.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe have offered $14-billion to support Canadians and we hope we can soon conclude an agreement with all the premiers that will ensure this funding is delivered to those who need it,\u201d Katherine Cuplinskas said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Ford\u2019s government introduced a sweeping new piece of legislation Wednesday it said will help the province\u2019s economy recover from the pandemic.\n\nThe omnibus bill \u2013 dubbed the COVID-19 Recovery Act \u2013 proposes to change 20 pieces of current legislation that govern the province\u2019s schools, municipalities, and justice system.\n\nMunicipal Affairs Minister Steve Clark said if passed, the bill would speed up environmental assessments, offer new consumer protections and help address unemployment.\n\nMr. Ford defended the bill and said it will help change an environmental assessment process that has been on the books for decades.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to dodge (environmental assessments) or anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we strengthen them, but we\u2019re going to do them quicker, smarter.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Clark said the bill would also create an economic agency \u2013 Invest Ontario \u2013 to help attract more international investment to the province.\n\nThe 188 page bill also includes measures announced by Education Minister Stephen Lecce this week to end school suspensions for students in junior kindergarten to Grade 3.\n\nMr. Clark said with limited days of sitting at the provincial legislature, it made sense to combined the different changes into one package.\n\nNDP Leader Andrea Horwath said the bill isn\u2019t actually a pandemic recovery plan at all, and is short on rent relief, solutions for long-term care, and details on schools required to truly help Ontarians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that Doug Ford is using the COVID-19 recovery as cover to plow ahead with changes that have nothing at all to do with recovering from this pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\nGreen party Leader Mike Schreiner said changing environmental regulations is not necessary to get the economy moving.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cCaring for nature, farmland and water is a vital part of the economic recovery, not something we sacrifice,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe government also tabled a motion on Wednesday to extend the province\u2019s state of emergency until July 24.\n\nThe current state of emergency declared at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic is set to expire July 15.\n\nMr. Ford\u2019s office said the government wants to extend the measure to ensure there is no gap between that declaration ending and a new bill extending Ontario\u2019s emergency measures taking effect.\n\nSolicitor General Sylvia Jones introduced that bill on Tuesday, saying the province will need to keep some emergency measures in place in the months ahead.\n\nOntario reported 118 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, and nine new deaths due to the novel coronavirus.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe total number of cases now stands at 36,178, which includes 31,805 marked as resolved and 2,700 deaths.\n\nThe province also reported 202 newly resolved cases, and completed more than 22,832 tests for the novel coronavirus over the previous 24 hours.\n\nThe number of people in hospital because of the virus, in intensive care units and on ventilators all slightly decreased.\n\nHealth Minister Christine Elliott said 30 of the province\u2019s 34 public health units reported five or fewer new cases, with 18 reporting none.","articleSummary":"Mr. Ford said he is involved in active talks with Ottawa to secure funding for

official start of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) at the White House.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, on his first official international trip in 19 months, hailed the Trump administration's relationship with his country, just four months before the U.S. presidential election is set to take place.\n\n\"President Trump, like in the best times of our political relations, we have received from you during my tenure as president understanding and respect, instead of insults toward my person \u2014 and more importantly, toward my country,\" the Mexican leader said at a Rose Garden ceremony.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador stuck to a historical theme for his Washington visit, comparing himself to 19th century Mexican President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, and Trump to Abraham Lincoln.\n\nHe discussed the often-mythologized relationship between the two historical presidents, emphasizing Lincoln's allegiance to the Republican Party.\n\n\"That is why I'm here, to express to the people of the United States that your president has behaved toward us with gentleness and respect,\" said L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n\nThe leader\u2019s comments were striking given Trump's rhetoric about Mexico and immigrants from the country, as well as the Trump administration's policies on immigration and border management.\n\nThe open praise came as Trump reportedly prepares to issue a new order terminating the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants more than half a million Mexican citizens the right to live and work in the United States.\n\nTrump originally terminated that program in 2017, coincidentally during then-presidential candidate L\u00f3pez Obrador's last visit to Washington.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBoth governments had forewarned the visit would deal only with economic issues related to the trade agreement, a priority amid the coronavirus pandemic that has collectively killed more than 160,000 people between the two countries.\n\n\"This visit has been described in extremes, as a historic mistake on the part of President L\u00f3pez Obrador and the Mexican government and as [equivalent to] the Nixon visit to China,\" said Ger\u00f3nimo

Visits are always important, they can be useful in moving things forward,\" Guti\u00e9rrez added.\n\nThe former ambassador said the importance of the economic relationship between the two countries could not be overstated, but he warned that the USMCA would not by itself resolve the economic crisis, particularly the one facing Mexico.\n\n\"If there is not a better climate [in Mexico] for both foreign and domestic investment, it will be very difficult to use both USMCA and the drift between the U.S. and China to our advantage,\" he said.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s visit seemed designed to quell worries that his administration is hostile to private investment \u2014 he has personally pulled the rug out from under several billion-dollar investments.\n\nBoth presidents are scheduled to attend a White House dinner with CEOs from both countries, including Apple's Tim Cook and Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, ranked as the world's fifth richest man by Forbes.\n\nWhile the economic message of the visit was regarded as positive, some observers said the risk amid a pandemic was difficult to justify.\n\n\"Presidents travelling during a pandemic \u2014 while I'm not thrilled with the idea, people travel during crises. The question is for what? There is no reason not to travel if the reason is so overwhelming,\" said Roberta Jacobson, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico.\n\n\"That's not what I see here,\" added Jacobson.\n\nAnd the visit's political repercussions could be lasting, particularly if former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenTucker Carlson ratchets up criticism of Duckworth, calls her a 'coward' Joe Biden wins New Jersey primary Biden wins Delaware primary MORE holds up in the polls against Trump.\n\n\"It's important to remember that the USMCA could not have passed in the United States without Democratic support,\" said Jacobson.\n\n\"The Democrats were not invited to the White House when USMCA was passed, and I don't think it's an accident that this visit was planned while Congress was in recess,\" she added.\n\nJacobson suggested L\u00f3pez Obrador could have reached out to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerAmy Kennedy wins NJ primary to face GOP's Van Drew House Democrat calls for 'real adult discussion' on lawmaker pay The Hill's Campaign Report: Primary Day in New Jersey MORE (D-Md.), who lives within driving distance of the capital.\n\nBut L\u00f3pez Obrador made the trip about Trump and the business community, eschewing contact with Democrats, Mexican Americans and other groups who are connected to Mexico.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador, who campaigned as a leftist man of the people, rankled some in the Mexican American community, particularly as Mexican immigrants in the United States provide one of the biggest sources of cash to the Mexican economy in the form of monthly remittances.\n\n\"The Mexican elite is represented there.

However, the federal economic and fiscal \u201csnapshot\u201d that was released on Wednesday promised tweaks are coming soon.\n\n\u201cAs economies reopen and business activity resumes, the government will soon announce changes to the CEWS to stimulate rehiring, provide support to businesses during reopening and help them adapt to the new normal,\u201d the update said. \u201cIn anticipation of this forthcoming announcement, the government has set aside additional funding as part of the 2020 Economic and Fiscal Snapshot.\u201d\n\nCEWS covers 75 per cent of an employee\u2019s wages for as much as 24 weeks, up to $847 per week. Nearly three million Canadian workers have had their jobs supported by CEWS, Finance Minister Bill Morneau said Wednesday, with that number still growing.\n\nThe $82.3 billion now projected to be spent on the wage subsidy forms part of the COVID-19-related surge in government spending that, along with a drop in tax revenue because of various restrictions, will inflate the federal deficit to a projected $343.2 billion for its 2020-21 fiscal year.\n\nBut while the government said Wednesday that 538,080 CEWS applications had been approved as of June 29, there are a number of businesses still hoping the measure can be further fine-tuned to allow them to benefit from it.\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Independent Business has said this could be done by eliminating or reducing the need for a 30-per-cent drop in revenue, or by setting up a \u201csliding scale\u201d so firms with smaller declines in revenue can gain access to a smaller subsidy. At any rate, the coming tweaks are overdue, according to CFIB president Dan Kelly.\n\n\u201cWe just started the new period of the wage subsidy for July and they still haven\u2019t announced the bloody changes to the wage subsidy that were promised back in mid-May,\u201d Kelly said in an interview.\n\nWe just started the new period of the wage subsidy for July and they still haven't announced the bloody changes to the wage subsidy promised in mid-May Dan Kelly, president, CFIB\n\nWhile the wage subsidy is good policy, it arrived after some shut-down businesses had already laid off staff, and it remains underused, Kelly said.\n\n\u201cBut now that businesses are able to open again, the wage subsidy could play a really key role in the recovery if they redesign it to be of support to employers at different levels of business losses,\u201d Kelly said.\n\nCanadian Manufacturers & Exporters said it similarly suggested \u201crelaxing the qualifying criteria\u201d for CEWS, bringing in a pro-rated subsidy and extending the program past August.\n\n\u201cManufacturers commend the efforts of the government to help businesses weather the crisis,\u201d said Dennis Darby, president and CEO of CME, in a press release on Wednesday. \u201cHowever, we are still hoping to see more support for the sector in the months to come.\u201d\n\nRestaurants Canada said earlier this week that 75 per cent of respondents to its recent survey said they are receiving the wage subsidy. The industry group recommended keeping the measure available for as long as there are restrictions in place, with a gradual drawdown in support as business recovers.\n\n\u201cThe 30 per cent revenue decline threshold should be scaled to support restaurants in their recovery, instead of serving as a disincentive to improving sales at the risk of losing access to the subsidy while businesses are still operating at a loss,\u201d the association added in a release.\n\n\u2022 Email: gzochodne@nationalpost.com | Twitter: GeoffZochodne","articleSummary":"The changes have yet to arrive, even as the subsidy, which began March 15, is now into its second 12-week period.\nHowever, the federal economic and fiscal \u201csnapshot\u201d that was released on Wednesday promised tweaks are coming soon.\n\u201cWe just started the new period of the wage subsidy for July and they still haven\u2019t announced the bloody changes to the wage subsidy that were promised back in mid-May,\u201d Kelly said in an interview.\nWe just started the new period of the wage subsidy for July and they still haven't announced the bloody changes to the wage subsidy promised in mid-May Dan Kelly, president, CFIBWhile the wage subsidy is good policy, it arrived after some shut-down businesses had already laid off staff, and it remains underused, Kelly said.\nCanadian Manufacturers & Exporters said it similarly suggested \u201crelaxing the qualifying criteria\u201d for CEWS, bringing in a pro-rated subsidy and extending the program past August."},"70":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"ars-technica","name":"Ars Technica"},"author":"Beth Mole","title":"CDC to issue new guidelines on reopening schools after Trump blowup","description":"Trump has intensified calls to open schools, despite clear plans and surging COVID-19.","url":"https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/science\/2020\/07\/cdc-to-issue-new-guidelines-on-reopening-schools-after-trump-blowup\/","urlToImage":"https:\/\/cdn.arstechnica.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/GettyImages-1213413571-760x380.jpg","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T22:50:40+00:00","content":"Enlarge\/ Schoolchildren wearing protective mouth masks and face shields attend a course in their classroom at Claude Debussy college in Angers, western France, on May 18, 2020, after France eased loc\u2026 [+3871 chars]","articleText":"On the heels of criticism from President Trump, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is planning to release updated guidance documents outlining how schools can safely reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVice President Mike Pence announced the upcoming documents Wednesday, just hours after Trump took to Twitter to blast the agency\u2019s current guidelines.\n\n\u201cWell, the president said today, we just don\u2019t want the guidance to be too tough,\u201d Pence said in a press briefing for the White House Coronavirus Task Force. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why next week, the CDC is going to be issuing a new set of tools, five different documents that will be giving even more clarity on the guidance going forward.\u201d\n\nIn tweets, Trump said he disagreed with the CDC\u2019s guidelines, calling them \u201cvery tough & expensive.\u201d He also threatened to cut funding to schools that refused to open before the November election.\n\nHowever, as NPR notes, schools on average receive 10 percent or less of their funding from the federal government, and those funds are typically aimed at supporting children with disabilities and those from low-income households. Further, Pence clarified during the press briefing that the White House would be \"very respectful\" if \"certain limitations\u201d prevent some school districts from reopening.\n\nConfusion\n\nIt\u2019s unclear which CDC guidelines or recommendations the president was criticizing. However, existing documents recommend that administrators consider closing schools for extended periods of time if there is \u201csubstantial community transmission\u201d of COVID-19\u2014which there currently is in many parts of the country.\n\nIn today\u2019s press briefing, Pence emphasized that the agency\u2019s guidelines should be tailored for each area and should not replace local or state rules or guidance. CDC Director Robert Redfield appeared alongside Pence and noted that the CDC\u2019s recommendations were not intended to be used \u201cas a rationale to keep schools closed.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration is not alone in urging schools to reopen. On June 26, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated its interim guidance, saying that it \u201cstrongly advocates that all policy considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of having students physically present in school.\u201d The organization noted that schools provide fundamental roles in \u201cacademic instruction, social and emotional skills, safety, nutrition, physical activity, and mental health therapy.\u201d As such, it argued that the benefits to children of having schools open for in-person learning may outweigh risks.\n\nBut many teachers and parents are still wary of in-person learning. In many school buildings and classrooms, social distancing measures are difficult if not impossible to follow.

L\u00f3pez Obrador had cordial words for Trump, too, saying that while they have disagreed, it was better to find common ground and avoid slinging insults.\n\nThe meeting was billed as a celebration of economic ties and the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, but critics in Mexico worried L\u00f3pez Obrador was being used as a political pawn to bolster the Trump campaign and his \u201cAmerica first,\u201d anti-illegal migration agenda. Despite the verbal backslapping in the Rose Garden, thorny issues \u2013 from immigration to investment \u2013 remain.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTrump has dialled back his harsh words since L\u00f3pez Obrador took office a year and a half ago. And L\u00f3pez Obrador signalled he wanted to put the insults in the past.\n\n\u201cAs in the best times of our political relations, during my term as president of Mexico, instead of insults toward me and more importantly against my country, we have received from you understanding and respect,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said.\n\nTheir relationship is an odd bromance: L\u00f3pez Obrador is a veteran leftist and Trump tacks right.\n\n\u201cSome thought that our ideological differences would have led us inevitably to confrontation,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said. \u201cFortunately, this bad omen didn\u2019t materialize and I consider that in the future there will be no need to break our good political relations, nor the friendship between our governments.\u201d\n\nThe two signed a declaration highlighting U.S.-Mexico relations and the USMCA. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decided not to come to Washington to celebrate the agreement, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nTrump and L\u00f3pez Obrador also pledged to co-operate in responding to the coronavirus, which has rocked both nations. Since March 2020, movement across the border has been restricted to essential travel while allowing the flow of goods and services. Last year, Mexico became the largest goods trading partner of the United States.\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador arrived at the White House after morning stops at the Lincoln Memorial and a statue of Benito Juarez, a former Mexican president and national hero. Trump and a military honour guard greeted him at the White House. The two posed for pictures and Trump flashed a thumb\u2019s up. They also were to have dinner at the White House with about 20 U.S. and Mexican business leaders, including Carlos Slim, one of the richest men in the world.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith the U.S. looking to reduce its dependence on China for parts and supplies, Mexico is well-positioned to step into the void, though U.S. businesses have viewed some recent actions taken by the Mexican government as harmful to U.S. investors and say they undermine the framework of the USMCA.\n\n\u201cIf there is not a better investment climate for both foreign and domestic private investment, it will be very difficult to use the opportunity of USMCA and the drift between China and the United States to our advantage,\u201d Geronimo Gutierrez, who was Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. in 2017 and 2018, said during a virtual event hosted by the Wilson Center.\n\nWith no meetings planned with former Vice-President Joe Biden, L\u00f3pez Obrador seemingly is banking that Trump will win a second term. The Democratic Party chairman, Tom Perez, recalled Trump\u2019s insults of Mexicans and said the president was now trying to take credit for a trade deal that Democrats in Congress helped make possible.\n\n\u201cLatino communities, immigrants, and the American people deserve a president with the empathy and experience to lead us forward, not a demagogue who cheers on bigotry from the White House,\u201d Perez said, urging voters to elect Biden.\n\nIn a letter to Trump last week, a dozen Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus denounced the meeting with Mexico\u2019s president as an effort to distract voters from rising cases of coronavirus in the United States and said it was a \u201cblatant attempt\u201d to politicize relations between the allies.\n\nWhen he arrived at the White House, L\u00f3pez Obrador and Trump did not shake hands as would have been customary before the pandemic. White House spokesman Judd Deere said all members of the Mexican travelling delegation were tested for the virus. The presidents sat at tables positioned many feet apart to sign their joint statement.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador likes to point out that Trump helped Mexico reach a deal with other oil-producing nations to cut production and aided Mexico in obtaining more ventilators to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Both presidents talk about a blossoming friendship that seems to stem from their pursuit of nationalist agendas.\n\nMany Mexicans, however, remain wary of Trump, whose denunciations are intended to rally his most loyal supporters. Trump has threatened tariffs to strong-arm Mexico into playing an uncomfortable role in U.S. immigration policy and insisted that Mexico will pay for a border wall meant to keep migrants out of the U.S.\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany wouldn\u2019t get into detail about what the two presidents said about immigration.

Some people may argue China also blocked US tech companies, such as Google, in the Chinese mainland. But this is a totally different scenario and is not comparable. China requested US internet companies, including Google, to comply with Chinese laws and regulations, which are reasonable demands, if they want to operate in China. However, Google withdrew from China in 2010 and announced it was \u201cno longer willing to continue censoring\u201d results on the website. TikTok, however, complies with US laws. The company has previously confirmed that data of US users is stored in the US, its data centers are located entirely outside of China, and does not send any user data back to China. In May, TikTok appointed American businessman and former Walt Disney Company top streaming executive Kevin Mayer as its CEO. Cautious and lawful as it is, TikTok is still facing huge uncertainty in the US. The US has become much too intolerant on China. China welcomes these US companies to return to the Chinese mainland as long as they comply with China\u2019s laws. In 2018, Google planned to return to the Chinese mainland by launching its Dragonfly search engine, but the company finally gave it up due to US political pressure. In addition, although China has never interfered in other countries\u2019 choice of internet applications, Pompeo did encourage India\u2019s ban on 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok.\n\nGoogle terminated its Dragonfly browser project in 2019 because Americans asked some tough questions about why a company whose motto is \u201cDon\u2019t Be Evil\u201d was creating a special browser that would make it easier for the authoritarian Chinese Communist regime to monitor and censor its own people. Dragonfly was supposed to be Google\u2019s foot back in the door of the Chinese market after reservations about CCP censorship and its appalling human rights record drove the company away in 2010. This is not a helpful bit of history for the Global Times to dredge up if it wants readers to feel sympathy for TikTok\u2019s plight.\n\nTikTok\u2019s PR department probably is not thrilled by any CCP effort to defend the company, since it has been trying very hard to convince the world that it is not really a \u201cChinese company\u201d at all. In May, after former Disney exec Kevin Mayer became CEO, TikTok tried arguing that it is not really Chinese, even though it is headquartered in Beijing, because parent company ByteDance was incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has global investors.\n\nTikTok knows that Beijing HQ is a problem, so it has been trying to set up a new global headquarters since the end of 2019. Singapore and London have been mentioned as possible locations, but not any city in the United States.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like dressing a panda in a business suit. It\u2019s unlikely to fool anyone,\u201d China First Capital chairman Peter Fuhrman opined at the time.\n\nTikTok \u2014 which is a bit like Twitter, but with very short videos instead of very short written posts \u2014 has unquestionably been a huge success story, arguably the most popular application from China across foreign markets. Industry analysts say the TikTok user base grew by over 80 percent last year, to include some 625 million users worldwide.\n\nTikTok faces criticism that it helps the CCP censor content from its users and their data. The U.S. Congress is calling for a thorough investigation of the relationship between TikTok, ByteDance, and the Chinese government. Some U.S. government and military agencies have already barred personnel from using TikTok, notably including the Transportation Security Agency (TSA) and the U.S. Army.\n\nWhen he was recently asked if Americans should use TikTok, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo replied, \u201cOnly if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nTikTok representatives insist their platform is secure, they have never given user data to the Chinese government, and all user information is kept in data centers beyond China\u2019s borders. The same company provides a similar but supposedly distinct application called Douyin for Chinese audiences. TikTok is one of several social media platforms to announce it will pull out of the Hong Kong market, supposedly out of concern over the security law Beijing recently imposed on the city.\n\nAs a U.S. intelligence official reminded ABC News on Tuesday, TikTok and ByteDance might claim independence from the Chinese Communist Party, but Chinese law explicitly states they must provide all information stored on their networks to Chinese authorities upon request.\n\n\u201cAll Americans should be concerned that their images, biometrics, locational and other data stored on Chinese apps must be turned over to China\u2019s state security apparatus upon request,\u201d the official cautioned.","articleSummary":"Some people may argue China also blocked US tech companies, such as Google, in the Chinese mainland.\nChina requested US internet companies, including Google, to comply with Chinese laws and regulations, which are reasonable demands, if they want to operate in China.\nIn addition, although China has never interfered in other countries\u2019 choice of internet applications, Pompeo did encourage India\u2019s ban on 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok.\nIndustry analysts say the TikTok user base grew by over 80 percent last year, to include some 625 million users worldwide.\nThe U.S. Congress is calling for a thorough investigation of the relationship between TikTok, ByteDance, and the Chinese government."},"75":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"bbc-sport","name":"BBC Sport"},"author":"BBC Sport","title":"Solheim Cup to stick to 2021 date","description":"The Solheim Cup will stick to its scheduled dates in September 2021, after it is announced the 2020 Ryder Cup would be played in the same month.","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/sport\/golf\/53342057","urlToImage":"https:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/live-experience\/cps\/624\/cpsprodpb\/182CC\/production\/_111902099_whatsubject.jpg","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T22:37:42.3256204Z","content":"A putt from Suzann Pettersen on the 18th green of the final match on the course sealed victory for Europe in 2019\r\nSolheim Cup organisers have reiterated their event will be played in September 2021 \u2026 [+1215 chars]","articleText":"Last updated on .From the section Golf\n\nA putt from Suzann Pettersen on the 18th green of the final match on the course sealed victory for Europe in 2019\n\nSolheim Cup organisers have reiterated their event will be played in September 2021 despite the men's Ryder Cup being rescheduled for the same month.\n\nThe 2020 Ryder Cup, postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, will take place from 24-26 September 2021, three weeks after the women's Solheim Cup.\n\nBoth of next year's biennial events will see the United States host Europe.\n\n\"2021 is shaping up to be an incredible year for golf,\" LPGA commissioner Mike Whan told BBC Sport.\n\n\"We are excited for this double-header, to celebrate all the great golfers, male and female, who play for the USA and Europe.\"\n\nWhan has stuck to his word after initially saying in April that \"nothing drowns out a Solheim Cup\", adding \"we wouldn't change our Solheim Cup if the Ryder Cup changed theirs\".\n\nAlexandra Arma, Ladies European Tour chief, added: \"Together with the LPGA, we are moving forward with plans for the Solheim Cup on 4-6 September.\n\n\"This year, we have all faced challenges we need to adjust to, and as part of the changing landscape of global sports events we will be assessing the long term impact of these changes on future Solheim Cup dates.\"\n\nEurope are the reigning Solheim Cup champions after winning the last event, in 2019, at Gleneagles, Scotland.\n\nNext year's return match takes place at Inverness Club in Ohio, before the Ryder Cup is held at Whistling Straits, in fellow Midwest state Wisconsin, with Europe also the defending champions.","articleSummary":"The 2020 Ryder Cup, postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, will take place from 24-26 September 2021, three weeks after the women's Solheim Cup.\nWhan has stuck to his word after initially saying in April that \"nothing drowns out a Solheim Cup\", adding \"we wouldn't change our Solheim Cup if the Ryder Cup changed theirs\".\nAlexandra Arma, Ladies European Tour chief, added: \"Together with the LPGA, we are moving forward with plans for the Solheim Cup on 4-6 September.\nEurope are the reigning Solheim Cup champions after winning the last event, in 2019, at Gleneagles, Scotland.\nNext year's return match takes place at Inverness Club in Ohio, before the Ryder Cup is held at Whistling Straits, in fellow Midwest state Wisconsin, with Europe also the defending champions."},"76":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"bbc-sport","name":"BBC Sport"},"author":"BBC Sport","title":"'Ryder Cup fate sealed by players'","description":"The indifference of leading golfers fatally diminished the 2020 Ryder Cup -

They are in it for only glory and that lies at the heart of the event's global attraction.\n\nBut the biennial match between Europe and the United States can only exist if the leading golfers from those two geographical entities buy into it. Were they to show any indifference, then the sport's most exciting show is fatally diminished.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Rory McIlroy, the world number one, was right when he told the BBC: \"The players are the ones that make the Ryder Cup. If they are not on board with it and don't want to play then there is no Ryder Cup.\"\n\nWith the likes of American Brooks Koepka adding that he would \"possibly\" opt out of a match without fans present and his captain Steve Stricker claiming it would be \"a crime\" if Wisconsin spectators were not allowed in, the fate of this year's match was sealed.\n\nThis despite organisers on both sides of the Atlantic being keen to play it from 25-27 September at Whistling Straits. They had television and sponsor agreements to satisfy and these significantly help bankroll the PGA of America and the European Tour.\n\nThroughout the months of debate over whether it should be postponed or not, those sitting on committees and boards with knowledge of the financial implications, spoke in favour of going ahead.\n\nPaul McGinley pointed to other sports making do behind closed doors, while another former European captain, Thomas Bjorn, raised the question over what guarantees exist to allow spectators to be present in 2021.\n\nCurrent skipper Padraig Harrington ventured that this year's collection of Ryder Cup players \"might have to take one for the team\" and play the match in the absence of the cheers and roars that make it such an evocative event.\n\nIt was clear to me there were two different camps: those who know the financial difficulties of navigating this period without holding an event that is their biggest cash cow, and the players.\n\nThese golfers had no interest in generating roars and cheers that would only be heard in living rooms. They need to hear them for themselves - that is what makes the Ryder Cup such an attractive proposition for them.\n\nAnd it was that view that ultimately held sway. The players are everything and their views are the ones that played the biggest part in the decision to postpone until 2021.\n\nThe financial hit for the European Tour this year is not massive, because they make far less money out of away matches. But the circuit now has to cope with a five-year cycle between the home matches that sustain its existence.\n\nBack in May, McIlroy said: \"I see it being pushed back until 2021 and, honestly, I think that will be the right call.\"\n\nHe knew then that September 2020 would not involve trying to help Europe defend the Ryder Cup. But it has taken weeks of intense negotiation to make it official.\n\nThe trickle-down effect is immense. The situation is vastly different to the late postponement of the 2001 match because of the 11 September attacks in the United States.\n\nBy then, the teams had been selected and the infrastructure was in place at the Belfry. Indeed, commemorative merchandise was kept the same and it was known as the 2001 match even though it was ultimately played a year later.\n\nNow the golf calendar is more complex and crowded. The Presidents Cup, played between a US and a Rest of the World team in non-Ryder Cup years, carries greater significance and is run by an increasingly powerful PGA Tour. Golf is also an Olympic sport.\n\nPostponing the Ryder Cup for a year has a profound knock-on for the entire golf schedule at a time of global pandemic and finding ways to satisfactorily mitigate those effects delayed this announcement, even though we all knew it was coming.\n\nOf course, a Ryder Cup without fans would not have been in keeping with the fervent traditions that are the bedrock of the matches in modern times.\n\nIt was not always that way. Back in the early days of this event - first contested in 1927 - many a match will have felt like it was being played in isolation, but not any more.\n\nIt has grown into one of the world's favourite sporting occasions and the players expect to hear the emotions they stir. That's their payment, if you like.\n\nThey are not the paid employees of a football club that might lift the FA Cup at an empty Wembley.

The first Black actress to play the DC Comics heroine in live-action, Leslie is stepping into the void left by Ruby Rose, who portrayed Batwoman\/Kate Kane and exited the series at the end of season 1.\n\n\"I am extremely proud to be the first Black actress to play the iconic role of Batwoman on television, and as a bisexual woman, I am honored to join this groundbreaking show which has been such a trailblazer for the LGBTQ+ community,\" Leslie said in a statement.\n\nAs EW previously reported, the new Batwoman's civilian alter ego is named Ryan Wilder and is the complete opposite of Rose's Kate. Here's the official character description: \"Ryan Wilder is about to become Batwoman. She's likable, messy, a little goofy and untamed. She's also nothing like Kate Kane, the woman who wore the Batsuit before her. With no one in her life to keep her on track, Ryan spent years as a drug-runner, dodging the GCPD and masking her pain with bad habits. Today Ryan lives in her van with her plant. A girl who would steal milk for an alley cat and could also kill you with her bare hands, Ryan is the most dangerous type of fighter: highly skilled and wildly undisciplined. An out lesbian. Athletic. Raw. Passionate. Fallible. And very much not your stereotypical All-American hero.\" As of right now, it appears as though Ryan is an original character and doesn't have an analogue in the comics.\n\nEven though someone new is stepping picking up the Batwoman mantle, the Warner Bros. TV series won't forget about Kate Kane \u2014 which showrunner Caroline Dries made clear after news broke that the show was going to introduce a new character instead of recasting Rose's part.\n\n\"As a lesbian who's been working as a writer for the past fifteen years, I'm well aware of the \"Bury Your Gays\" trope and I have no interest in participating in it,\" Dries said in a statement. \"That's why it's important to me as the showrunner to clarify any misinformation out there about Kate Kane and recasting Batwoman. Like you, I love Kate Kane \u2014 she's the reason I wanted to do the show. We'll never erase her. In fact, her disappearance will be one of the mysteries of season two. I don't want to give away any of our surprises, but to all our devoted fans, please know that LGBTQ+ justice is at the very core of what Batwoman is and we have no intention of abandoning that.\"\n\nIn addition to starring on God Friended Me, Lewis' previous credits include BET's The Family Business, MacGyver, and the film Always a Bridesmaid.\n\nBatwoman is expected to return in January on the CW.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nRelated content:","articleSummary":"Batwoman type TV Show network The CW genre SuperheroMeet your new Batwoman.\nEW has learned that God Friended Me's Javicia Leslie has been cast as the Crimson Knight on the CW's Batwoman.\nHere's the official character description: \"Ryan Wilder is about to become Batwoman.\n\"That's why it's important to me as the showrunner to clarify any misinformation out there about Kate Kane and recasting Batwoman.\nLike you, I love Kate Kane \u2014 she's the reason I wanted to do the show."},"81":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"news-com-au","name":"News.com.au"},"author":"Alexis Carey","title":"Oz Lotto $50 million winner: New clues in unclaimed ticket mystery","description":"Oz Lotto $50 million winner: New clues in unclaimed ticket mystery","url":"https:\/\/www.news.com.au\/finance\/money\/wealth\/oz-lotto-50-million-winner-new-clues-in-unclaimed-ticket-mystery\/news-story\/a25797ba8d769c43a23d6403cc649276","urlToImage":"https:\/\/cdn.newsapi.com.au\/image\/v1\/734704280930266850e77bfbe18626e5?width=650","publishedAt":"2020-07-08T22:29:00Z","content":"A NSW resident is walking around completely unaware they have become an instant multi-millionaire but new details regarding their identity have emerged.On Tuesday night, one ticket holder won the ent\u2026 [+2345 chars]","articleText":"A NSW resident is walking around completely unaware they have become an instant multi-millionaire \u2013 but new details regarding their identity have emerged.\n\nOn Tuesday night, one ticket holder won the entire Oz Lotto division one prize of $50 million \u2013 the highest jackpot in a decade.\n\nHowever, the winning entry was unregistered, so lottery officials had no way of contacting the ticket holder.\n\nThe staggering prize is still yet to be claimed \u2013 but now, the search has been narrowed down to one exact location.\n\nRELATED: Cash to hit 45,000 bank accounts today\n\nRELATED: ATO\u2019s grim warning for Aussies\n\nAustralia\u2019s official lottery provider, The Lott, has revealed the winner is from the south coast town of Sussex Inlet and purchased their entry from Inlet Newsagency, Shop 5, 172 Jacobs Drive, Sussex Inlet.\n\nThe ticketholder held the only division one winning entry nationally in Oz Lotto draw 1377, drawn Tuesday, July 7.\n\nEvery player who bought a ticket from that agency is being urged to double check their entry today.\n\nInlet Newsagency owner Dimitrios Spyrakis said he was thrilled to discover his outlet had sold such a huge division one winning entry.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible news,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing for both the community of Sussex Inlet and also our winner.

Jeff McIntosh\/The Canadian Press\n\nOne of the reckonings Canada must face in the eventual aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic is the failure of many long-term care facilities to protect their residents from the disease.\n\nHow bad is it? To date, 81 per cent of the people who have died from COVID-19 in Canada have been residents of nursing homes. In comparable countries, the toll has been much lower, according to a new report from the Royal Society of Canada: 27 per cent in England and Wales; 49 per cent in Scotland; 28 per cent in Australia; 34 per cent in Denmark and Germany; and 49 per cent in Sweden.\n\nThe question that needs to be asked is whether this horror show was specific to the times and could be avoided in future with reforms brought in by provincial governments, which have jurisdiction over long-term care, or whether the virus exploited systemic problems that need to be addressed at the national level.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Royal Society of Canada, the country\u2019s national academy of arts and sciences, believes the latter is true. The pandemic, it says in its report, \u201cexposed long-standing, widespread and pervasive deficiencies in the sector.\u201d\n\nThose deficiencies include: a lack of consistent standards from province to province for training personal-care workers, who are the main providers of care in nursing homes; the low pay, usually without benefits, those workers receive; and a lack of integration across the health care sector and the long-term care sector.\n\nThat last one means that, even though the most vulnerable patients routinely transfer between hospitals and nursing homes, there is little co-ordination between the two. \u201cIf a whole-system approach had been in place, then hospitals would not have discharged people who tested positive for COVID-19 back to nursing homes without proper infection control,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe report also points out that there is no standard in Canada for the minimum number of hours of daily care a nursing-home resident needs in order to have a reasonable quality of life. But one study in the United States pegged the number at 4.1 hours a day, which is significantly higher than the Canadian average of 3.3.\n\nThis lack of consistent standards, and the reliance on the lowest-paid and least-trained employees to provide as much as 90 per cent of the care in nursing homes, is set against the demographic backdrop of a country in which 25 per cent of the population will be 65 or older by 2036, with the most rapid growth in people 85 and up, the report says.\n\nAs well, dementia is now a \u201cmajor driver\u201d of admissions to nursing homes. According to the report, 3 per cent of the Canadian population will have some degree of dementia by 2036. But low-paid nursing home workers don\u2019t have the training to care for these patients, and they often have to endure the verbal and physical abuse that dementia can trigger.\n\nPerhaps the most telling detail in the report is the fact that Canada\u2019s long-term care system grew out of the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601. It\u2019s a system based on the belief that caring for the elderly is the role of churches and charities, and as such it remains outside of medicare.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd yet, Ottawa and the provinces spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year subsidizing beds for the elderly in a system of homes that are run by charities, governments and private companies. The funding varies from province to province, as does the availability of beds. People who desperately need nursing-home care must wait months, or even years, for a spot. All too often, they wind up in acute-care beds in overcrowded hospitals.\n\nOne way or another, taxpayers are on the hook for the care of elderly Canadians who don\u2019t need a hospital bed but do need a high level of care. Yet that care fell tragically short when it was most needed.\n\nThere is a consensus developing among provincial politicians and advocates for senior citizens that only Ottawa can provide the funding needed to better train and better pay care workers. The Royal Society of Canada agrees, and says the work-force issue is the most pressing one facing the sector.\n\nBut if Ottawa is going to pony up, then it can and should set national standards. It\u2019s high time that caring for our most fragile senior citizens stops being seen by Canadians and their governments as a make-do system based on an outdated charitable model, and starts being treated with some of the same rigour applied to the medicare system.","articleSummary":"To date, 81 per cent of the people who have died from COVID-19 in Canada have been residents of nursing homes.\nThat last one means that, even though the most vulnerable patients routinely transfer between hospitals and nursing homes, there is little co-ordination between the two.\nAs well, dementia is now a \u201cmajor driver\u201d of admissions to nursing homes.\nPerhaps the most telling detail in the report is the fact that Canada\u2019s long-term care system grew out of the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601.\nThere is a consensus developing among provincial politicians and advocates for senior citizens that only Ottawa can provide the funding needed to better train and better pay care workers."},"83":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"google-news-ca","name":"Google News (Canada)"},"author":"Simon Little","title":"Three new deaths as B.C.

The latest version of the connection standard isn\u2019t actually faster than its predecessor (still offering up the same 40 gbps as its predecessor), but there are some key improvements on-board, including some updated system requirements.\n\nHere\u2019s the rundown, per Intel,\n\nDouble the minimum video and data requirements of Thunderbolt 3. Video: Support for two 4K displays or one 8K display. Data: PCIe at 32 Gbps for storage speeds up to 3,000 MBps. Support for docks with up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports. PC charging on at least one computer port. Wake your computer from sleep by touching the keyboard or mouse when connected to a Thunderbolt dock.Required Intel VT-d-based direct memory access (DMA) protection that helps prevent physical DMA attacks\n\n\n\nThe new version will be compatible with both Thunderbolt 3 and old USB connections, and it\u2019s set to arrive at some point later in 2020 on laptops sporting Tiger Lake CPUs.

When President Donald Trump moved his Republican nominating convention to Florida after yanking it from North Carolina last month, the extra hassle and cost at least carried the benefit\u2026 [+8785 chars]","articleText":"DUNEDIN, Fla. \u2015 When President Donald Trump moved his Republican nominating convention to Florida after yanking it from North Carolina last month, the extra hassle and cost at least carried the benefit of shoring up his support in the country\u2019s highest-value swing state.\n\nFour weeks later, with coronavirus cases flaring across the state, the move may instead make it that much harder for Trump to win Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes \u2015 votes that, if he loses them, would almost certainly guarantee his loss nationally.\n\n\u201cIf they move forward with that convention, with the numbers the way there are, people are just going to think they\u2019re crazy,\u201d said Kim Nymeyer, president of the North Pinellas County Democratic Club, adding that Trump\u2019s insistence on holding an in-person coronation amid a pandemic gives her side yet another argument. \u201cI do think Trump is taking the rope and hanging himself without any help from us.\u201d\n\nTrump seemed to back away from his demand for a packed house in an interview with Voice of America on Tuesday. \u201cWhen we signed a few weeks ago, it looked good. And now all of a sudden it\u2019s spiking up a little bit and that\u2019s going to go down. It really depends on the timing. . . . We can do a lot of things, but we\u2019re very flexible.\u201d\n\nPlans for the three days of rallies at a minor league hockey arena in Jacksonville in late August, meanwhile, continued moving forward Wednesday.\n\nOne top Republican close to the White House acknowledged things could, indeed, go badly and wind up hurting Trump\u2019s chances of winning the all-important state.\n\n\u201cIt could be OK. If he has a decent crowd, and he gets up and knocks the speech out of the park. That\u2019s the best case,\u201d he said on condition of anonymity. \u201cWorst case? No one comes, it looks empty and there\u2019s a bunch of protests, which becomes the big story in the middle of a pandemic.\u201d\n\nComplications for that best-case scenario are already apparent. Under Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s standing executive order, indoor facilities cannot be filled to beyond 50% capacity, meaning, in the case of Jacksonville\u2019s VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, only 7,500 would be admitted inside, just 1,300 more than were in the sparsely attended Tulsa, Oklahoma, campaign rally on June 20.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is currently planning to test every single one of the attendees daily for the coronavirus, but if cases are still surging in Florida, daily tests of Trump delegates and supporters would raise questions about why so many medical resources were being devoted to an unnecessary celebration.\n\nFinally, there is the choice of the day itself, Aug. 27, the anniversary of \u201cAx Handle Saturday,\u201d the day in 1961 when Blacks conducting a lunch counter sit-in were brutally attacked by about 200 white people wielding ax handles and baseball bats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the lowlights of Jacksonville\u2019s history,\u201d said Mike Binder, a University of North Florida political science professor whose recent poll showed that Jacksonville residents, by a 58-42 margin, opposed having the convention there right now. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this going well\u2026. Nobody else had their hand up wanting this thing.\u201d\n\nTrouble For Trump In His New Home State\n\nEven before the pandemic swept all else aside, there were signs that Trump ought not to have been counting on his newly adopted home state to deliver for him.\n\nAt a late January meeting of Nymeyer\u2019s Democratic club at the Dunedin Scottish Arts Foundation\u2019s meeting room a few blocks from the town\u2019s main drag, volunteers had to set out extra rows of folding chairs to accommodate all the arrivals.\n\nNymeyer asked for first-timers to raise their hands and explain why they had come. To a person, they mentioned Trump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just pissed off,\u201d said an African American woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to make sure we win this year,\u201d said a white male retiree.\n\nAdded an older white woman: \u201cI\u2019m just here because I\u2019m mad as hell.\u201d\n\nNymeyer thanked them for coming. \u201cWe need you to stop yelling at your TV and start volunteering.\u201d\n\nAt the time, she and other Democrats in the area worried that a favorite of the party\u2019s progressive wing, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) could win the nomination, making it hard to win a more moderate swing state like Florida.\n\nChip Somodevilla\/Getty Images President Donald Trump participates in a White House event Tuesday with students, teachers and administrators on how to reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. Concerns about COVID-19 led North Carolina to reject requests to loosen public health rules for the Republican National Convention.\n\nBut with former Vice President Joe Biden leading the ticket, that worry is gone. Even better, Nymeyer said, the former Sanders and Warren supporters appear to agree that the overarching goal of removing Trump is paramount. \u201cThe votes are out there. The key is to go get them,\u201d she said.\n\nSteve Schale, the Democratic consultant who ran former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in Florida and is now working for a pro-Biden super PAC, said he assumes Trump and his campaign will do a competent job of turning out Republican votes, which will get them to about 48%, while he hopes Democrats will do a decent job with their voters, which would get Biden to 48%.\n\nWinning the remaining 2% plus 1 will involve persuading people, he said, adding that, right now, most polls show Biden is ahead 5 or 6 percentage points in the state. \u201cThe question is, how much of that is in the moment?\u201d\n\nStarting with the famously razor-thin, 537-vote margin of the 2000 election, just two presidential races in Florida have been decided by a margin larger than a point and half, and even those were close: George W. Bush\u2019s reelection in 2004, when he won by 5 points, and Obama\u2019s 2008 election, when he won by 3.\n\nThe other two presidential contests, the three governor\u2019s races since 2010 and, in 2018, the U.S. Senate race, have been so close that the average victory margin has been 0.8 percentage point.\n\nGiven that, Schale said, the Biden campaign should be happy to be where it is. \u201cThey\u2019re ahead. They\u2019re doing something right. I don\u2019t know how much of that is organizational and how much of that is Trump being Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Will Vote For A Shoe Over Donald Trump\u201d\n\nThat Trump is Trump, though, may well be the best argument Democrats have heading into November.\n\nFour years ago, Adriana Rivera, a Puerto Rican native new to South Florida, had been captivated by Sanders\u2019s primary run but had been turned off by eventual nominee Hillary Clinton and did not bother to vote.\n\nAfter 3\u00bd years of Trump in the White House, she said, she will not repeat that mistake. \u201cThis time around, I will vote for a shoe over Donald Trump. We didn\u2019t know what a Trump presidency would be like. Now we\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019ve seen how horrible it is.\u201d\n\nOthers in the progressive community \u2015 Rivera again supported Sanders in the primaries this time around \u2015 and Florida\u2019s Puerto Rican community feel the same way, she said, particularly in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s botched response to the pandemic, which in Florida has been exacerbated by a dysfunctional state unemployment claims system that has disproportionately hurt Latinos, who tend to live paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\u201cI think people are beyond the point of frustrated and are now just angry,\u201d said Rivera, who works with the Florida Immigrant Coalition.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to HuffPost requests for comment regarding its Florida strategy. At a Trump rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, in February, communications director Tim Murtaugh ridiculed the idea of even needing one: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win Florida. It\u2019s only a matter of when the Dems give up.\u201d\n\nThat, though, was before the pandemic spread across the country following weeks of Trump downplaying it, claiming it would go away on its own, even calling it a \u201choax\u201d pumped up by Democrats and the news media to hurt his reelection chances.\n\nThe informal Republican White House adviser said Republicans\u2019 superior voter turnout operation would, in the end, let Trump win Florida.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably down 2 to 4 points. And we\u2019ll win by 1 to 2 points,\u201d he said.\n\nOne longtime GOP veteran of Florida politics, however, said that assessment assumes both that the pandemic fades from the state and employment has rebounded to where it was before the crisis.\n\n\u201cThey know this. It\u2019s like a baseball team that\u2019s losing. You can\u2019t fire the team, but you can fire the coach,\u201d said Mac Stipanovich, the former chief of staff to Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in the late 1980s who then ran Jeb Bush\u2019s first, unsuccessful, bid for governor in 1994. \u201cIf things go well, he gets the credit. If things go badly, he gets the blame.\u201d\n\nWhich is why, he added, he cannot understand Trump\u2019s insistence on staging his convention in a state that he has to win.\n\n\u201cThe way they dumped on North Carolina, picked Jacksonville. They can\u2019t so far raise the money that\u2019s necessary, for people that might not come, in the context of a pandemic, in one of the state\u2019s hot spots, with the possibility of a Chicago 1968 in terms of protests,\u201d Stipanovich said. \u201cThe potential advantage for the Trump campaign is so small compared to the risk, I would be worried about it\u2026. It\u2019s just a weird dynamic. I don\u2019t see how it helps.\u201d\n\nImportant conversations are happening now. Add your voice!

The finance minister emphasized he would like to take advantage of the opportunity presented to him by the world\u2019s central banks and issue more longer-term debt while rates for trusted sovereigns such as Canada are near zero.\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea, but one that could be more complicated in the aftermath of the Fitch decision to drop Canada\u2019s debt to AA+ from AAA. Canada\u2019s debt is still valuable, but perhaps not as valuable as it used to be, so Morneau might have to work harder to get the yield he wants, starting with a concrete commitment to keep the budget under control.\n\nFor now, he has little to worry about.\n\nThe Bank of Canada and its peers have acknowledged they intend to keep interest rates near zero to make it easier for politicians to borrow\n\nRemarkably, the federal government\u2019s actual cost of borrowing is on track to be about $4 billion lower this year because the Bank of Canada dropped the benchmark rate to 0.25 per cent and is creating hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase government bonds. It\u2019s the one reason the COVID-19 recession hasn\u2019t been exacerbated by a financial crisis.\n\nDebt-service charges are now about one per cent of GDP, compared with about 14 per cent in the early 1980s and around 12 per cent in the mid-1990s, two earlier periods of economic weakness.\n\nThat\u2019s by design. The Bank of Canada and its peers have acknowledged that one reason they intend to keep interest rates pinned near zero is to make it easier for politicians to borrow in order to combat the recession. Central bankers learned during the Great Recession that they can be very aggressive without stoking inflation, and they are applying those lessons now.\n\nBut it would probably be a mistake to assume that current monetary policy can continue indefinitely without consequence. The risk is that investors will start to worry about inflation and demand higher interest rates to compensate for it. That\u2019s especially true for potential buyers of the 10- and 30-year bonds that Finance has been issuing in greater numbers.\n\n\u201cFiscal management will require a medium-term plan with a solid anchor and a significant reserve for contingency in an uncertain world,\u201d Bennett Jones, the Toronto-based law firm, said in a June economic outlook written by several former Finance officials, including David Dodge, who also served as Bank of Canada governor.\n\nDodge was deputy minister at Finance in the 1990s, the last time Canada had to work at convincing creditors to buy its debt at a favourable yield. He helped devise and manage the spending cuts that Jean Chr\u00e9tien and Paul Martin implemented to balance the budget for the first time in a generation and avoid a debt crisis. Their efforts restored Canada\u2019s status as a AAA borrower.\n\nLife has been easier for the prime ministers and finance ministers that have followed Chr\u00e9tien and Martin. Chr\u00e9tien\u2019s Liberal governments instilled a commitment to fiscal discipline that was unique among rich economies. For years, Canada\u2019s AAA boast thundered in global debt markets, because fewer and fewer countries and companies proved themselves worthy of pristine credit scores from all the major rating agencies.\n\nAt times, Canada has even been described as a safe haven, putting upward pressure on the currency as outsiders clamoured for its debt.\n\nBut those days probably are over.\n\nNow, we\u2019re no different than the United States, which was downgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s in 2011 when that agency lost faith in the ability of Congress to responsibly restrain spending.\n\nFitch dropped Canada to AA+ partly because Trudeau\u2019s minority government had shown little interest in constraining spending before the COVID-19 crisis\n\nPolitics is also responsible for Canada getting kicked out of the club.\n\nFitch dropped Canada to AA+ partly because Justin Trudeau\u2019s minority government had shown little interest in constraining spending before the COVID-19 crisis. Fitch also expressed doubt about the relationship between Ottawa and the provinces, observing that Canada\u2019s \u201cdecentralized fiscal framework increases the complexity\u201d of doing something about a combined federal-provincial debt that is on track to reach 115 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nMorneau appeared to acknowledge that convincing investors to commit to Canada for one decade, three or even more could be a challenge given the size of the deficit. \u201cWe, the collective we, will have to face up to our borrowing and ensure it is sustainable for future generations,\u201d he said in prepared remarks for the Commons.\n\nThe finance minister will probably have to do more than plead with voters to remember the 1990s. It\u2019s time for a proper fiscal anchor that isn\u2019t easily unmoored. He needs a new one anyway. In the last election, the Liberals said they would ensure Canada retained a top mark from all the main rating agencies. It must have looked like such an easy bar to clear. Then the world changed.\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@postmedia.com |","articleSummary":"It\u2019s a good idea, but one that could be more complicated in the aftermath of the Fitch decision to drop Canada\u2019s debt to AA+ from AAA.\nThe risk is that investors will start to worry about inflation and demand higher interest rates to compensate for it.\nFitch dropped Canada to AA+ partly because Justin Trudeau\u2019s minority government had shown little interest in constraining spending before the COVID-19 crisis.\nThe finance minister will probably have to do more than plead with voters to remember the 1990s.\nIn the last election, the Liberals said they would ensure Canada retained a top mark from all the main rating agencies."},"89":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"breitbart-news","name":"Breitbart News"},"author":"Joel B.

Although the health department\u2019s policy is to not publicly identify individual settings where people may have contracted the virus, Dart said those large gatherings \u201cmore than likely\u201d contributed to the spike. \u201cIn the past few days, we\u2019ve seen almost 500 new cases, and we had several large events just over two weeks ago, so I guess we just connect the dots,\u201d Dart said.\n\nThe video of the press conference confirms that Dart stopped short of blaming the Trump rally explicitly.\n\nIn addition to Black Lives Matter protests outside the Trump rally, there were also protests earlier in the month.\n\nAnd there was also a large rally for Juneteenth the day before the Trump rally, headlined by Al Sharpton \u2014 a fact that the AP story fails to mention.\n\nFrom the USA Today on June 19:\n\nAbout a mile away from the arena where President Trump will hold a Saturday rally, the Reverend Al Sharpton spoke to a field filled with people on the campus of Oklahoma State University \u2013 Tulsa, near where the city\u2019s infamous 1921 race massacre took place. Sharpton, one of several speakers for this year\u2019s Juneteenth celebration in Tulsa, said \u201cthey tell their children that Lincoln freed the slaves.

We must do more. We must educate ourselves and understand the potential repercussions of using such language and be aware of the hurt it can cause.

The decision, authored by Justice Mark Warby of the High Court of England and Wales, was Steele's first major court loss.\n\nREAD THE COURT'S DECISION\n\n\"This allegation [about the Putin payments] clearly called for closer attention, a more enquiring approach and more energetic checking,\" Warby wrote. \"Orbis failed to take reasonable steps in this regard, and to that extent, a breach of the Fourth Principle is established.\"\n\nThe \"Fourth Principle\" refers to a portion of the law penalizing the dissemination of inaccurate information.\n\nThe dossier made additional inaccurate claims, including that the pair provided foreign policy advice to Putin, the judge found.\n\nConservatives have pointed out that the dossier, funded indirectly by the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee (DNC), contained a slew of other apparent inaccuracies. Among the unsubstantiated claims in the dossier: that ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with Russian hackers; that the Trump campaign was paying hackers working out of a nonexistent Russian consulate in Miami; that a lurid blackmail tape of Trump existed and might be in Russian possession; and that former Trump aide Carter Page was bribed with a 19 percent share in a Russian company.\n\nPage is suing the DNC for defamation, and the Justice Department (DOJ) is probing why the FBI relied so heavily on the dossier to investigate the Trump team, along with how news of the dossier leaked to the media after senior FBI officials briefed President Trump on its contents. The FBI's legal counsel later described the warrant to surveil Page as \"essentially a single source FISA\" wholly dependent on the dossier.\n\nThe FBI's Crossfire Hurricane team investigating the Trump 2016 campaign received multiple indications that Steele -- one of the key informants in their investigation -- was part of an elaborate \"Russian disinformation campaign,\" according to several footnotes from DOJ Inspector General (IG) Michael Horowitz's report on FBI misconduct that was declassified earlier this year.\n\nThe FBI heavily relied on Steele's dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant to spy on Page, in which FBI officials asserted that Page was an \"agent\" of Russia. However, the FBI did not share the information about the Russian disinformation campaign with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) when it moved to obtain the warrant, just as it did not tell the court that another Trump aide had denied collusion during a recorded conversation with an FBI informant.\n\nOne of the footnotes, which was previously redacted in its entirety, read: \u201cThe [REDACTED] stated that it did not have high confidence in this subset of Steele\u2019s reporting and assessed that the referenced subset was part of a Russian disinformation campaign to denigrate US foreign relations.\" That subset referred to Cohen, whom Steele's dossier claimed had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents. Special Counsel Robert Mueller was unable to substantiate that claim, and Cohen has denied it.\n\nThe footnote goes on to state that a 2017 report \u201ccontained information \u2026 that the public reporting about the details of Trump\u2019s [REDACTED] activities in Moscow during a trip in 2013 were false, and that they were the product of RIS \u2018infiltra[ing] a source into the network\u2019 of a [REDACTED] who compiled a dossier of information on Trump\u2019s activities.\u201d\n\nHOROWITZ REPORT CONTRADICT 'EXPERT' NARRATIVES THAT FISA RULES WERE STRICTLY OBSERVED\n\nThe newly released footnotes gave other reasons to doubt the knowledge and credibility of Steele's main sources, as well as the accuracy of Horowitz's own report.\n\n\"When interviewed by the FBI, the Primary Sub-source stated that he\/she did not view his\/her contacts as a network of sources, [REDACTED] with whom he\/she has conversations about current events and government relations,\" one of the previously hidden footnotes reads.\n\nThat statement directly contradicted the executive summary of Horowitz's IG report, which asserted that Steele's Primary Sub-source \"used his\/her network of sub-sources to gather information that was then passed to Steele.\"","articleSummary":"British ex-spy Christopher Steele must pay damages to two Alfa Bank partners for publishing \"inaccurate or misleading\" material in his infamous dossier, including claims the banks funneled \"illicit cash\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a British court ruled Wednesday.\nThe decision, authored by Justice Mark Warby of the High Court of England and Wales, was Steele's first major court loss.\nThe dossier made additional inaccurate claims, including that the pair provided foreign policy advice to Putin, the judge found.\nThe FBI heavily relied on Steele's dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant to spy on Page, in which FBI officials asserted that Page was an \"agent\" of Russia.\nThat subset referred to Cohen, whom Steele's dossier claimed had traveled to Prague to meet with Russian agents."},"98":{"status":"ok","totalResults":748,"source":{"id":"associated-press","name":"Associated Press"},"author":"DAVID BAUDER","title":"How many people saw 'Hamilton'?

Data is coming in to the Nielsen company, too, but won\u2019t be released until Disney gives the go-ahead. \u201cHamilton\u201d is the poster boy for how the science of measurement is not keeping up with how entertainment content is being consumed.\n\nFull Coverage: Entertainment\n\nDisney+, which announced in May that it had signed up 54.5 million paid subscribers worldwide, will not release information on how many people subscribed in time to get \u201cHamilton\u201d or how many watched until its next quarterly earnings report, a spokeswoman said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNielsen offers plenty of information on who watched television shows the past week. For example, Fox News Channel drew 5.7 million viewers on Friday night when it showed President Donald Trump speaking at Mount Rushmore.\n\nTelevision viewership is widely known because advertising is the business\u2019 cornerstone. Advertisers need to know exactly how many eyeballs they\u2019re getting for the money.\n\nIt\u2019s different for streaming services, which are primarily supported by subscriptions. The industry\u2019s giant, Netflix, set a trend by keeping details about how how many people watch their programs largely a secret.\n\nNielsen said it is repeating what it did in the early days of cable television by letting networks and their corporate owners dictate how much information about how many people are watching is released. Nascent networks figured it was a buzzkill if people learned that the audiences for heavily-promoted shows were small.\n\nThe same is true for the streaming services. They\u2019re also nervous about how viewing patterns will be depicted \u2014 a new streamed show will often get a big audience when it is first released, but quickly drop off.\n\nNielsen has pushed during the pandemic to release more information, including a weekly listing of the top streamed shows based on minutes viewed.\n\nWith the market becoming crowded with more streaming services, the pressure is rising among creators and marketers for more dependable information on how popular the shows really are, Brian Fuhrer, Nielsen\u2019s senior vice president for product leadership, said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis is a really important inflection point for the ecosystem,\u201d Fuhrer said.\n\nRest assured, though.
